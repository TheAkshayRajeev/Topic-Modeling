I just work e2 80 9d; we believe his employment experiences and involvement with specialized organizations reflect his passion for the job    : Positive relationships with nearly all of the authority figures in his life thus far Expressed appreciation and gratitude toward supervisors and mentors who took the time to offer him opportunities and encourage his zeal for the job Positive attitude; will be respectful and accommodating in his interactions with superiors Follows the rules; will adhere to departmental policies and procedures Open and receptive to new ideas and the changing trends in the fire service today; will make good use of constructive criticism    : Despite his relatively young age, we were impressed with candidate e2 80 99s self-assurance and comfort level in handling complex emergencies Along this line, he has been involved in leadership roles with various teams during emergency situations Focused, well-prepared, and competent Level-headed and assertive in areas within his range of expertise and competence While he will defer to line supervisors and incident commanders at this point in his career, we believe this individual possesses a good deal of leadership potential    : Candid, open, and straightforward in discussing some of the regrets and disappointments he has had in his life thus far Acknowledged his own contribution to problems and setbacks when they occurred (there have not been many) No brushes with law enforcement; denied any illicit drug use in his life Honest and modest; will hold himself accountable for his actions on and off the job Began assuming responsibility for himself and his actions at an early age Engaged to be married to a graduate student at the University of Chicago who he has dated for the past three years    : Stable, even-tempered, and relatively well-adjusted; not easily rattled or angered Not prone toward prolonged periods of worry or anxiety; tends to be optimistic and action-oriented in the face of difficulties Supportive base of family and friends As might be expected this energetic individual enjoys vigorous recreational outdoor activities as means to reduce job-related tension and frustration Engaging and talkative; will find support and reassurance by talking things out with his shift-mates after troubling and emotionally-charged calls for service Special Training, Orientation & Concerns None. I    Average  (assesses cognitive abilities)    Spelling          s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Abbinanti provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that included essential details and a degree of elaboration when it was necessary. This applicant had a great deal of direct and relevant experience to report. In all of his written exercises this individual consistently demonstrated the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Professional and informative reports and documents are not likely to be problematic for this applicant. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Abbinanti to possess  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his occupational accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above. Graduating from Lakes Community High School in 2013, Mr. Abbinanti e2 80 99s primary focus was on vocational coursework offered through the school e2 80 99s tech campus where he began preparing himself for a fire service career. He has been attending the College of Lake County off and on since 2012 where he is reportedly e2 80 9chalfway e2 80 9d completed with his associate e2 80 99s degree in fire science and EMS. However, it should be noted that this individual has attended specialized coursework and seminars all over the country regarding technical rescue and other specialized fire service skills, and has also served as an instructor in those areas for advanced and experienced firefighters. All things considered, Mr. Abbinanti will not have difficulty mastering the essential information and skills required of firefighter and medic.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Abbinanti to be a strong candidate for the position in question as he received e2 80 9cstrong e2 80 9d rating on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and paramedic. It is not often that a relatively young candidate receives superlative ratings on essential job functions and skills, yet Mr. Abbinanti is an exception. Many candidates tout their e2 80 9cpassion e2 80 9d and e2 80 9cdedication e2 80 9d for the fire service, yet Mr. Abbinanti has actively demonstrated those qualities in the way in which he has prepared himself for his chosen career, which he has wanted since his high school years. This applicant has a remarkable thirst for knowledge and new skills, which we believe will persist throughout his career. Not particularly focused on landing a traditional full-time fire service position until recently, Mr. Abbinanti has applied himself in obtaining specialized knowledge in a variety of areas which will serve him and the department well in the years ahead. A cursory review of his resume and training experiences will attest to that. We like the balance he brings to the position in terms of his pleasant and collaborative interpersonal style, progressive and positive attitude, and his strong task orientation. Simply put, Mr. Abbinanti should prove to be an asset to the department and the community. In light of our glowing review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Abbinanti be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Palatine, Illinois. \"',\n",

Name: Cameron Abraham Position: Firefighter Age: 30 Department: Fire Department Date: February 7, 2020   y  : Energetic and talkative individual, who sipped a high-energy drink throughout his interview with the psychologist Takes charge of the conversation Communicates clearly, but leaves no doubt where he stands; not afraid to let people know what is on his mind The candidate can be confrontational in asserting his thoughts and ideas in the presence of his peers Exudes self-confidence to a fault Self-centered and self-absorbed Exceptionally preoccupied with personal appearance and his muscular physique Will likely be seen by his fellow firefighter/paramedics as a narcissist Expected to struggle to forge comfortable and genuine relationships with his peers Lacks for a sense of self-awareness; does not see himself as others see him  AND PERSONA   : Claims that he likes to help people, and that his job does not feel like work In keeping with our  about his self-absorbed and narcissistic personality, he enjoys having a job where he can bolster his physically fitness The candidate has found the camaraderie associated with being a firefighter/paramedic as very satisfying We suspect that he likes the attention that he gets from interacting with his peers at the fire station States that working with his fellow firefighter/paramedics reminds him of being on the swim team in high school Should be viewed as a credible first responder on  due to his level of fitness and confidence in his abilities     : EMT-B from the College of DuPage in 2013; took a refresher course more recently Earned his paramedic e2 80 99s license through Waubonsee Community College and Delanor Hospital in 2016 B.O.F. received in 2018 through the Romeoville Fire Academy Employed by the Chicago Ridge Fire Department as a firefighter/paramedic from June of 2019 to just recently, February of 2020 Expected to honor his commitments and obligations On the other hand, he has experienced some difficulty acknowledging or envisioning his own contribution to problems or setbacks when they occurred One brush with law enforcement in 2007 for using a fake ID We believe he generally understands the imperative that being a public servant requires him to be alert, attentive, and focused without the residual effects of any type of substance (legal or illegal)     : Most of his employment history involves working at his family e2 80 99s retail clothing stores in the south suburbs Other jobs, such as the one recently in Chicago Ridge, have been of a significantly shorter duration Outspoken and quick to comment to his peers and superiors when things do not suit him to his satisfaction The applicant acknowledges that he can look annoyed and inconvenienced when taking orders from his superior officers His discomfort is further increased when given constructive feedback by his superior officers As such, he is unlikely to be open-minded and receptive to new ideas and constructive criticism In his behalf, he reports no disciplinary actions or terminations against him at any previous place of work  ability to cope with stress, remain composed, be assertive  : Has dealt with his fair share of emergencies and trauma States that EMS calls have far exceeded calls to suppress fires With only one station in Chicago Ridge, the candidate e2 80 99s former department ran upwards of 3500 calls a year Has been able to cope with some of the more stressful and gruesome aspects of life in the fire service and EMS work thus far Says serious emergency calls are e2 80 9cno big deal, e2 80 9d especially drug overdoses Sounded cynical when discussing the situations surrounding people who OD; he and his colleagues administer antidotes, and then the patients revive and start yelling at his crew Moreover, he is e2 80 9cnot distracted e2 80 9d by family members in anguish over death and injury to their loved ones Hence, we have concerns about this individual e2 80 99s bedside manner in dealing with patients in terms of empathy, compassion, and the ability to convey reassurance Not surprisingly, this person keeps himself in very good physical condition Dating a woman he met at the health club who the candidate characterized as a e2 80 9cgirl version of him e2 80 9d  As this report indicates the candidate does not take feedback very easily; as such it will be hard to work with him and correct behaviors that are upsetting to his superior officers. He will need encouragement to accept constructive feedback in the spirit in which it is given e2 80 93 to improve job performance and for self-development. I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Abraham submitted a Personal History Form that was not only accurate, but it also contained sufficient information and detail. We also administered another writing sample, which included a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career. On this exercise, the applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability by using the appropriate grammar and syntax along with providing the pertinent details. While Mr. Abraham e2 80 99s performance on  was mixed, he has obtained the proper credentials for the job. All things considered, the candidate has the ability to learn the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate has not demonstrated emotional intelligence as evidenced by our  in  of this report outlining Mr. Abraham e2 80 99s insensitivities to both patients and their families.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Abraham to be a less than acceptable applicant for the position in question. Self-centered and narcissistic, Mr. Abraham arrived at our office wearing a T-shirt that allowed his bulging muscles to show. Along with his overly casual manner of dress for a job-related interview, Mr. Abraham carried a high-energy drink with him, which only added to his hyper disposition. The candidate comes across as overly confident and self-absorbed, which will not go well with the more experienced firefighters at the station. Most of the candidate e2 80 99s career to date has involved working in his family e2 80 99s retail clothing stores in Chicago e2 80 99s south suburbs. At age 30, Mr. Abraham has less than a year of practical experience as a firefighter/paramedic, having been employed with the Chicago Ridge Fire Department from June of 2019 until February of 2020. His reasons for leaving so soon are unclear, and he failed to elaborate on the subject. The candidate claims that the most difficult problem he has faced in his life has been his inability to land a full-time job as a firefighter/paramedic. According to the candidate, he has tested for almost ten different fire departments and fire protection districts, but to no avail. On the other hand, Mr. Abraham states that this is the first time that he has had to take a psychological examination. Our sense is that Mr. Abraham will be a problem employee for all of the reasons presented in this report. Therefore, in light of our cautious review, we would not recommend that Mr. Abraham be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the City of Elmhurst. \"',\n",

Name: Miguel Alcazar Position: Part-Time Firefighter Age: 25 Department: Fire Department Date: September 19, 2019     : Well-groomed personal appearance Appropriately attired in a dress shirt and tie for his appointment at our office Looks young and rather inexperienced Appeared anxious as he cracked his knuckles several times during his interview with the psychologist    : Polite and respectful manner Open and honest in his dealings with people Looks forward to the camaraderie connected with working in the fire service States that the close interactions with his peers in the fire service is what distinguishes the field from law enforcement, which the candidate characterized as a e2 80 9cloner e2 80 99s job e2 80 9d Avoids arguments or disputes unless he is being adversely impacted by a coworker e2 80 99s improper behavior    : Rates high on our measures of altruism Possesses an acceptable service orientation Looks forward to a job where he can learn new things and train on a regular basis However, the candidate lists other compelling reasons for wanting the job in question, centering on the variety and excitement associated with this line of work He scored exceptionally high on our measures of excitement-seeking    : Two classes short of his associate e2 80 99s degree in fire science from McHenry County Community College Earned his EMT-B in 2017 from McHenry County Community College B.O.F. was received through the Bensenville Fire Academy in 2019 Has been employed as an EMT-B with Superior Ambulance since October of 2017 Presently employed as a firefighter/EMT-B with the McHenry Township Fire Protection District    : Exceptionally hardworking individual; logs as many as 80 hours a week at both of the above-listed jobs In addition, the applicant will often pick up an extra shift While not one to be cited for tardiness, the applicant acknowledges that he could show up for his assigned shift earlier than the five minutes he normally allows Overall, scored high on our measures of conscientiousness    : Raised by an aunt who taught this individual to have a healthy respect for those in positions of authority Made a number of positive statements about his past and present supervisors Prefers a supervisor who is supportive of his needs For example, going to school and working two jobs, the applicant appreciates a supervisor who is mindful of his potential schedule conflicts Also appreciates an approachable supervisor Finally, he has never been terminated from any previous place of work, but he did receive a couple of disciplinary actions early in his career for tardiness    : This person performed 40 hours of time in the ER during his training for his EMT-B certification Most of this individual e2 80 99s other exposure to trauma has been during his time with Superior Ambulance In particular, he has been involved with body removals, often of corpses that have been deceased for significant lengths of time We are impressed with this person e2 80 99s sense of empathy for patients as the applicant spoke of instances where people had few if any relatives to care for them after being discharged from medical facilities    : Grew up under difficult circumstances after the tragic loss of his mother in an automobile accident when he was very young Fortunately, his father e2 80 99s sister, his aunt, took him into her house and raised him alongside her own children The values instilled in the applicant have served him well throughout his life thus far and contributed to behaving in a mature fashion Smoked marijuana a few times, but ceased using the substance one he began training for his EMT-B Holds himself accountable for his actions    : He has endured a great deal in his 25 years In addition, he has learned to cope with a father who has been in and out of his life for many years, suffering from substance abuse problems Able to persevere under stress Has a good support network with his family and friends Possesses no harmful habits which would impair his ability to perform the job in question The candidate consumes alcohol in moderation Engages in exercise three to four times a week in order to reduce tension and stress Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Making sure that he arrives earlier for his assigned shift than the five minutes he normally allows Help and encouragement when he enrolls in classes for his paramedic e2 80 99s license I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Alcazar made a concerted effort to provide accurate and complete information on his Personal History Form. We also administered another written exercise asking for him to describe both a highlight and a setback during the course of his short career. Once again, the applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability. This is not surprising given his mastery level score on the  portion of . The applicant e2 80 99s ability to write well predicts positively for handling the paperwork and report writing requirements of the job in question. While these demands are somewhat limited, they are critical when it comes to obtaining reimbursement for medical services administered by the department. Given his interest in continuing his education and training, his determination should help him succeed during paramedic training, although it will be a challenge for him given his initial failure when he first enrolled in EMT training. Overall, we believe that Mr. Alcazar possesses the proper thinking skills to master the essential elements of the job.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Alcazar to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. As described in  of this report, the candidate was raised under difficult circumstances. When he was very young his parents and an uncle were traveling back to the Chicago area from visiting relatives in Iowa. Along the way there was a terrible automobile accident that took the life of Mr. Alcazar e2 80 99s mother and her brother. While Mr. Alcazar e2 80 99s father was not seriously injured in the accident, he descended into a life of substance abuse shortly thereafter. Fortunately, his father e2 80 99s sister, Mr. Alcazar e2 80 99s aunt, took in the applicant and raised him with her own children, three sisters. In speaking of his aunt as well as the three sisters, Mr. Alcazar refers to them as family. Meanwhile, he and his father have been estranged due to the latter e2 80 99s drug problems. About three years ago, the applicant decided to pursue a career in the fire service and EMS. Through a friend, he accepted a ride-along with the Woodstock Fire Department, and the candidate became convinced that this was the career for him. Of course, Mr. Alcazar is still young and very much a work-in-progress, yet he does possess the potential to work well in his chosen profession. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Alcazar be given an offer to work as a part-time Firefighter for the Algonquin-Lake in the Hills Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

These qualities were also apparent in an exercise asking the applicant for a highlight and setback he experienced in his life. Mr. Baker, who majored in English while attending the University of Iowa, is able to express himself effectively in writing and demonstrates proper writing mechanics. This will, then, will help the applicant in completing the necessary paperwork and reports for the position in question. This bodes well for recovering the costs for emergency medical services. The above-reported test results from  indicate that this individual is quite bright overall. Mr. Baker lists achieving  grades throughout high school and college, and since graduating from the University of Iowa in 2010, he has also done quite well with performing different roles in his employment experience. We sense that this candidate has a sensitive and empathetic side, which predicts positively for treating patients and interacting with people in traumatic situations. Overall, we believe that Mr. Baker possesses the proper thinking skills that will allow him to learn and perform the essential duties and responsibilities connected with the job of a firefighter/paramedic.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Baker to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. Unlike most candidates to become a firefighter/paramedic, this person brings to the job no practical experience or training in the fire service or emergency medicine. In fact, the candidate commented that his initial intent was to be an English teacher, as evidenced by his college major at the University of Iowa. During his summers, Mr. Baker was employed by the Skokie Park District, largely through his father e2 80 99s contacts, since the latter individual was a 25-year veteran with the Department of Public Works for the Village of Skokie. After college the candidate decided that teaching was not for him even though his girlfriend, and now wife, went into education as a school social worker. His spouse is now employed at a school Des Plaines, Illinois. In deciding against teaching, Mr. Baker went to work in business and has held a couple of responsible jobs. Nevertheless, business left Mr. Baker feeling unfulfilled, and he then gave serious thought to following in his late father e2 80 99s footsteps and working for a municipality. Even though his father was a longtime employee with the Village of Skokie, at no time did we detect a sense of entitlement on the part of the applicant that would cause him to believe that he was owed a job with the Village. To the contrary, he makes a good case in his own right for getting hired despite his lack of  as mentioned previously in this report. Therefore, in light of our generally positive review, we would recommend that Mr. Baker be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Skokie. \"',\n",

Yet, this individual quickly engaged our office staff and other candidates during his assessment time at our offices. We do not believe he is arrogant or in any way full of himself. Nevertheless, this applicant may be a bit cavalier with details and thoroughness, especially when it comes to paperwork and mundane tasks. We would recommend that he receive clear and specific expectations about the importance of some of the more tedious aspects of the job. I    Average  (assesses cognitive abilities)    Spelling          s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Barrera initially provided a sloppily typed and incomplete account of his personal and professional background. In fact, the lack of essential information provided and unanswered questions led us to kick it back to him upon his arrival at our offices where he obligingly did a much better job of providing details, dates, and explanations. According to Mr. Barrera, he tried to complete the initial submission on his cell phone which was ill-advised. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated average writing ability, as he demonstrated the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences. However, his spelling and grammar could stand some improvement. Overall, it was our sense that this individual may be rather cavalier with vital paperwork which is an essential part of the job. As such, he will need to some guidance and reminders about the importance of producing professional and informative reports as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Barrera to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his educational and occupational accomplishments to date, and by scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above. Mr. Barrera graduated from Walter Payton College Preparatory High School in Chicago in 2007 with average grades. With the intention of becoming a gym teacher, he opted to stay close to home in pursuing his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in physical education at Concordia College in 2012. Although he may not apply himself diligently at times with respect to formal classroom material, this applicant has the ability to master the essential information and skills required of a police officer.  The youngest of three children, Mr. Barrera spent his developmental years in Chicago where he continues to reside with his parents. During his interview, Mr. Barrera reported that his father served as a Cook County Sheriff e2 80 99s Department Deputy for over 15 years before changing careers and eventually becoming a school principal with Chicago Public Schools. Proud of his father e2 80 99s accomplishments, Mr. Barrera initially wanted a career in education and worked as gym teacher for five years with CPS. Feeling that he needed to make a stronger contribution in the public service field, he began applying for police officer positions and is now a probationary police officer with the Chicago Police Department. Although he is very much enjoying his training and education with CPD, Mr. Barrera has been involved with his girlfriend for over three years who resides in Batavia, and they want to start a family. Admitting that it may be an adjustment for a e2 80 9ccity boy e2 80 9d such as himself to relocate to suburban community in order to accommodate her disinterest in moving to Chicago, Mr. Barrera struck us as a flexible and adaptable person, who will be able to make the transition rather smoothly. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Barrera to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question, as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. Although he may come across with a bit of swagger initially, Mr. Barrera is a down-to-earth and generally upbeat individual who comes across as confident and capable. Describing himself as a hard worker, Mr. Barrera has been consistently employed in some capacity since his college years, and we believe he will be reliable, dependable, and positive in his work habits. Although he may seem a bit rough around the edges, most will find him to be an agreeable and upbeat individual who will maintain a positive attitude. As we noted in I and III of this report, Mr. Barrera may need some reminders about the importance of diligence and thoroughness with some of the more mundane and routine aspects of the job. Over time, we feel he has the potential to develop into a competent and capable addition to the department. In light of our review of his qualifications, we would recommend that Mr. Barrera be extended an offer of employment to serve as a Police Officer in the City of Batavia, Illinois. \"',\n",

I    Average  (assesses cognitive abilities)    Spelling          s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Bassett provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that included basic details, but not much more. On his behalf, he was much more elaborative during his interview than he was on paper. Nevertheless, this individual is fully capable of expressing himself in complete and coherent sentences that contain proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Mr. Bassett is expected to produce professional reports, but he may need to be a bit more descriptive at times. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Bassett to possess average to possibly  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his grades throughout high school and college, and by his occupational accomplishments to date. Mr. Bassett graduated from Antioch High School in 2003 with a reported e2 80 9cB e2 80 9d average. During his high school years, he participated in baseball (mostly outside of school) and worked part-time. Admittedly confused and bewildered about his vocational goals, Mr. Bassett wanted to further his formal education, but did not know where he was going career-wise. As a result he obtained an associate e2 80 99s degree in general studies in 2009. Once he found his e2 80 9cpassion e2 80 9d in the fire service, Mr. Bassett has applied himself diligently to better his skills and qualifications for a career position including the attainment of his associate e2 80 99s degree in fire science in 2015. All things considered, this individual has the ability to master the essential information and skills required of a firefighter and paramedic.  Mr. Bassett is the younger of two children who was raised primarily by his mother in Antioch where he attended local public schools. According to Mr. Bassett, his parents, who are both flight attendants, split up before he was born. However, Mr. Bassett maintained that his father was and remains an involved part of his life. Mr. Bassett talked about his struggles to find a meaningful career path in his life until he eventually discovered the fire service through the suggestion of some of his friends. Since that time, his life has stabilized considerably as he has worked hard to better his skills and qualifications for a career position. While working as a contract medic and firefighter with nearby Mundelein, he applied for a career position with that department along with several others. Disappointingly, he was dismissed from the process due to what was presumed to be e2 80 9cnumerous police contacts e2 80 9d gleaned during his background investigation. He is not quite sure about that. Nevertheless, not only did he not get the job with Mundelein, he also lost his status as a contract paramedic assigned to that department. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Bassett to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. While he may not be a particularly distinguished applicant, Mr. Bassett is an energetic and smart individual who appears to work quite comfortably in groups. At the same time, he may come across as a bit outspoken and opinionated; however, our assessment indicates that he is very open-minded and coachable. We do not envision this candidate overstepping his bounds with his supervisors, and he will frame his many questions in a tactful and respectful manner in an attempt to learn. With further training and experience, we believe Mr. Bassett should prove himself to be a competent and reliable contract firefighter and medic. In summation, we would recommend that Mr. Bassett be extended an offer of employment to serve as a Contract Firefighter with the Countryside Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

Similarly, this individual likes to move and act quickly. Although he appears to possess sound judgment, he may benefit from some guidance in being a bit more deliberate and circumspect in approaching complex and chaotic situations. I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Bassett provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that included basic details, but not much more. On his behalf, he was much more elaborative during his interview than he was on paper. Nevertheless, this individual is fully capable of expressing himself in complete and coherent sentences that contain proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Mr. Bassett is expected to produce professional reports, but he may need to be a bit more descriptive at times. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Bassett to possess average to possibly  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his grades throughout high school and college, and by his occupational accomplishments to date. Mr. Bassett graduated from Antioch High School in 2003 with a reported e2 80 9cB e2 80 9d average. During his high school years, he participated in baseball (mostly outside of school) and worked part-time. Admittedly confused and bewildered about his vocational goals, Mr. Bassett wanted to further his formal education, but he did not know where he was going career-wise. As a result, he obtained an associate e2 80 99s degree in general studies in 2009. Once he found his e2 80 9cpassion e2 80 9d in the fire service, Mr. Bassett has applied himself diligently to better his skills and qualifications for a career position including the attainment of his associate e2 80 99s degree in fire science in 2015. All things considered, this individual has the ability to master the essential information and skills required of a firefighter and paramedic.  Mr. Bassett is the younger of two children, and he was raised primarily by his mother in Antioch where he attended local public schools. According to Mr. Bassett, his parents, who are both flight attendants, split up before he was born. However, Mr. Bassett maintained that his father was and remains an involved part of his life. Mr. Bassett talked about his struggles to find a meaningful career path in his life until he eventually discovered the fire service through the suggestion of some of his friends and his wife. Since that time, his life has stabilized considerably as he has worked hard to better his skills and qualifications for a career position. While working as a contract medic and firefighter with Countryside FPD, he has received a few conditional offers for career positions. He claims that his first choice of a department is Skokie given its reputation among other firefighters he knows. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Bassett to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. While he may not be a particularly distinguished applicant, Mr. Bassett is an energetic and smart individual who appears to work comfortably in groups. At the same time, he may come across as a bit outspoken; however, our assessment indicates that he is very open-minded and coachable. We do not envision this candidate overstepping his bounds with his supervisors, and he will frame his many questions in a tactful and respectful manner in an attempt to learn. With further training and experience, we believe Mr. Bassett should prove himself to be a competent and reliable firefighter and medic. In summation, we would recommend that Mr. Bassett be extended an offer of employment to serve as a Firefighter with the Village of Skokie. /ERL\"',\n",

On his behalf, Mr. Beyer is a bright, motivated, and determined individual who we believe should catch on rather quickly. Nevertheless, a bit of patience on the part of his field training officers and first-line supervisors as we anticipate that this candidate has the potential to become an effective and competent officer over time. I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Beyer provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background, which included essential details and a degree of elaboration whenever it was necessary. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated average to slightly  writing ability as he consistently expressed himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Report writing and documentation should not be particularly difficult for this individual. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Beyer to possess slightly  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his academic achievements to date, and by the manner in which he was able to express his thoughts and ideas (orally and on paper) during his assessment. Mr. Beyer maintained  grades throughout his high school and college years despite being very involved in various sports. In fact, he was three-sport athlete at Hersey High School earning all-conference honors and state qualification on the track and field team. Without a clear sense of career direction, Mr. Beyer played football all four years at Elmhurst College where he graduated with a bachelor e2 80 99s degree in sports management. All things considered, this bright and determined applicant has the ability to master the essential information and skills required to become a police officer.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Beyer to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all but one of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. According to Mr. Beyer, he still struggled with identifying a viable vocational plan for himself after graduating from Elmhurst College in 2017. Taking a long, hard look at his desires, needs, and situations that have been gratifying for him, Mr. Beyer began seriously considering police work as both of his grandfathers and a cousin of his were all involved in law enforcement. Once deciding on this career path, this determined and persevering individual has been testing rigorously for the past year, but did not anticipate how difficult the hiring process may be e2 80 93 especially without any relevant or direct experience. Over the past year and a half, Mr. Beyer has learned a lot about the tact, diplomacy, and assertiveness required in this line of work by working as a security officer at his former high school. In that capacity, he has had to defuse some confrontations and fights, and has also proved to be an available mentor and coach for several of the students there. From our perspective there is a lot to like about this confident, engaging, and determined applicant in terms of his ability to get along amicably with most people, strong team orientation, and solid work ethic. Moreover, this individual seems equally motivated to perform both the customer service and enforcement aspects of the job. In our opinion, Mr. Beyer should prove to be a very coachable and trainable recruit who will be able to catch on rather quickly despite his lack of direct exposure to police operations. In light of our favorable review of his qualifications and personality characteristics review, we would recommend that Mr. Beyer be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Elmhurst, Illinois. \"',\n",

Despite qualifications and related experience, applicant will still need coaching and guidance regarding the enforcement piece of the position in question I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Bong submitted a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that contained key details and appropriate elaboration whenever it was necessary. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On each of his exercises, this applicant demonstrated average to slightly  writing ability. For example, this applicant has the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. As such, we believe that he will handle acceptably the paperwork and report writing piece of the position in question. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Bong to possess average to  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his educational accomplishments to date, and by the way he was able to express his thoughts and ideas (orally and on paper) during his assessment. Finally, the candidate is a compassionate and concerned individual who will demonstrate the appropriate amount of emotional intelligence demanded by the job in question.  The younger of two children, Mr. Bong grew up and continues to reside in Hanover Park, where he attended local public schools. According to Mr. Bong, his cousin was a member of the Algonquin Police Department Explorers Post when the candidate graduated from high school. Without a definitive career objective in mind, this cousin urged Mr. Bong to go on a ride-along with the Algonquin Police Department, which he did in 2011. This, then, led to his taking classes in criminal justice at a local community college. In October of 2016, Mr. Bong e2 80 99s father passed away which reportedly left him and his family reeling with grief. According to Mr. Bong, he simply e2 80 9clet himself go e2 80 9d with respect to taking care of himself and maintaining optimal physical conditioning. For example, after being extended an offer of employment by the Palatine Police Department in December of 2016, Mr. Bong failed the physical agility test and subsequently resigned from Palatine Police Department less than a week into his academy training. Since then, Mr. Bong has taken some appropriate steps to prepare himself better for his chosen career path in law enforcement by obtaining relevant experience in police operations as both a staff assistant and an administrative service officer for the Hoffman Estates Police Department. We have one noted concern regarding this candidate e2 80 99s self-confidence, as he struck us as being rather unassertive, and some of the resistance and opposition he will encounter in this line of work could prove challenging initially. Nevertheless, based on our favorable observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Bong to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question, and we view him as ready and capable of fulfilling supervisory expectations or performance standards. Thus, we would recommend that Mr. Bong be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Schaumburg, Illinois. \"',\n",

We also administered two other writing samples (both of which were typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated average writing ability as he expressed himself in complete and coherent sentences containing proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. This candidate tends to be clear and concise in his writing style and we believe he has the ability to produce professional and informative reports and documentation as a police officer.

This assertion is supported by his grades during high school and college, and by the manner in which he was able to express his thoughts and ideas (orally and on paper) during his assessment.

According to Mr. Bravo, the prospect of a public safety career as a police officer is appealing to him because of the honor and respect that goes along with the position in the eyes of his family and most people. An altruistic and well-intentioned applicant, Mr. Bravo is expected to extend himself on the job in order to serve the needs of the community, and he should prove to be an energetic employee overall. In this regard, we liked the balance he brings to the position in terms of his likable and friendly interpersonal style and his solid work habits. While not a particularly distinguished candidate, as he may appear a bit e2 80 9crough around the edges e2 80 9d in terms of polish and sophistication, he is a sincere person who looks forward to the mental and physical challenges that will help him grow and develop personally and professionally.

in particular, the candidate is critical of older members of the fire service While the candidate claims that he avoids speaking his mind in front of more senior fire officers, his reason is that he is still on probation We suspect that once the candidate clears his probation period, he will feel much freer to express his views and opinions, which will not be well-received by his fellow firefighters Overall, the candidate comes across as overly confident to the point that his peers have characterized his attitude as bordering on arrogant    : Seeks a career where he can contribute to society in a positive way In his own words, the job in question is more than just about making money At the same time, he is drawn to the security and stability of the job, as exemplified by its good pay and benefits There is also a side to his personality that borders on thrill-seeking, which predicts for the applicant being attracted to the variety and excitement of the fire service    : Earned his EMT-B in 2014 from Malcolm X College Received his paramedic e2 80 99s license from Ingalls Hospital and South Suburban College during 2017 B.O.F. was granted by the Romeoville Fire Department in 2018 Spent nine months with the Riverside Fire Department in 2018 Since August of last year, 2018, the applicant has been employed as a firefighter with the York Center Fire Protection District    : As with many individuals who possess a thrill-seeking side to their personality, the candidate shows the classic signs of being selectively motivated For those tasks which are mundane and tedious, like completing paperwork or performing routine chores around the firehouse, he will exhibit a lack of initiative The candidate claims that he does not complain given his status as a probationary firefighter; however, once he is off probation, he is likely to behave differently As such, the applicant is likely to align himself with the malcontents who populate any firehouse    : While the applicant is likely to show attitude around the firehouse, he understands the importance of respecting the chain-of-command To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he reports never having been terminated or disciplined at any previous place of work With that said, this person will look to his superior officers to be supportive and operate in his best interests as opposed to siding with the command staff or village administration Finally, it is worth noting that this individual spent approximately nine years working as his own boss selling and brokering automobiles    : The candidate claims that he is not bothered by emergencies and trauma We sense that he is able to remain calm and in control during emergency situations In his time working in the fire service and EMS, he has witnessed a number of fatalities from full-arrests to automobile accidents and gunshot wounds We did notice, however, that this individual lacks empathy For example, he stated as recently as the night before his appointment at our office, this person spoke about going right back to sleep after handling a fatality that occurred while he was on the night shift    : This person experiences a hard time seeing himself as others see him As such, it will be difficult for him to accept constructive feedback on his behavior and performance Furthermore, we do not see this person holding himself accountable for his actions, and as a result, he is likely to offer a lot of excuses to justify his behavior In his behalf, he has avoided the use of drugs or alcohol during the course of his lifetime due in large part to his father e2 80 99s struggles with alcohol addiction On the other hand, his driving record has been less than stellar, to include an arrest for driving on a suspended license    : There is a part of this person e2 80 93 due in large part to his emotional detachment e2 80 93 that will allow him to cope with stress, as it will not affect him the same as it does other people In addition, this person possesses a devotion to rigorous physical exercise that results in his working out all seven days of the week Another way of reducing tension and stress for this person involves engaging in dangerous activities, like riding his motorcycle at high speeds To date, he has been involved in no less than three accidents with his high-powered motorcycle In short, he is a thrill-seeker with the need for speed Special Training, Orientation & Concerns This individual will bring to the job an attitude that will make it hard for him to hear helpful feedback; hence, we are reluctant to recommend any training or developmental suggestions since they are unlikely to prove effective I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Caffie, as noted previously in  of this report, failed to provide the necessary information regarding his prior work history, especially that pertaining to his nine years of self-employment. On another written exercise discussing a career highlight and setback, Mr. Caffie managed to demonstrate acceptable writing mechanics. Because the applicant is selectively motivated and dislikes mundane and routine activities, Mr. Caffie is unlikely to perform the paperwork and report writing piece of the position in question. As observed by the above-reported test scores, Mr. Caffie appears to be rather bright. In addition, the applicant earned a bachelor e2 80 99s degree in biology from the University of Illinois at Chicago. The candidate scored at the mastery level on both subtests on . On the other hand, as we also mentioned in , Mr. Caffie lacks empathy, which is the major component of the concept emotional intelligence.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Caffie to be an unacceptable applicant for the position in question. The candidate claims that it was in January of 2014, when a fire broke out at his grandfather e2 80 99s house, that he first turned his thoughts toward joining the fire service. Prior to that time, Mr. Caffie worked entirely for himself selling cars on his own. While we do not think that his self-employment caused him to be less than sociable, it is clear that working autonomously and free from interacting with peers has suited his interpersonal orientation rather well. The close confines of the firehouse require a person who can get along easily with others without showing attitude. In addition, firehouses demand the completion of chores -- most of which are mundane and unexciting, yet necessary e2 80 93 like cleaning and routine maintenance. We are concerned that this candidate will not show much enthusiasm for these kinds of duties and responsibilities. Finally, Mr. Caffie was also a less than enthusiastic candidate based on his behavior during his assessment at our office. Everything from his manner of dress to his gum chewing and yawning behavior worked against him and mitigated his being seen as a serious candidate for the job. Therefore, in light of our cautious review, we would not recommend that Mr. Caffie be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Mount Prospect. \"',\n",

Under no circumstances should the information or contents of this report be shared with the applicant unless under the direct supervision of a trained psychologist. We recommend that this report be considered valid for one year.

Personality does change over periods of time as a result of life experiences, successes and failures over the course of life, and major life events and traumas. In the case of public safety candidates, the exposure to tragic, traumatic, and emotionally charged events in the line of duty, coupled with the need for a quick adaptation to a paramilitary culture predicts for an increased likelihood of adjustment difficulties and possible personality changes quicker than other professions. Moreover, because of the unique combination of skills required for each position, this report pertains to the job in question, only.

Name: Eric Cahanin Position: Police Officer Age: 29 Department: Police Department Date: March 5, 2018     : Neatly trimmed beard and dressed in business casual attire Confident, pleasant, and respectful in his presentation Came across as warm and engaging; open and talkative Maintained good eye contact and demonstrated receptive and relaxed body language Despite a lack of law enforcement experience, this individual should be perceived as a credible, mature, and approachable officer by citizens    : Considerate, polite, and amiable; should be able to get along with just about anyone Moderately outgoing; may not call much attention to himself Easygoing and down-to-earth in his demeanor; not loud or boisterous Emphasized his desire to work collaboratively with others toward a common goal or mission; strong team orientation Nothing particularly flashy or charismatic about this candidate, yet he should be able to fit in comfortably with his fellow officers, citizens, and supervisors    : Rates rather high on our measures of altruism Although he has not been involved in any charitable or volunteer activity, applicant took pride in his strong customer service background Feels good about himself when he is able to make a positive impact on the lives of others Looks forward to the mental and physical challenges involved in a law enforcement career Especially interested in being able to e2 80 9cgive back e2 80 9d to the citizens in his home community of Lindenhurst Will be respectful and professional in his interactions with the public  relevant work and life experience  : Associate e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice from Kaplan University (online) in 2015 Accompanied officers on ride-alongs with the Kenosha Police Department on two occasions a couple of years ago Most of his knowledge and information about police work comes from his affiliation and friendship with past and present police officers, including several with whom he plays recreational hockey Many years of customer service in the restaurant industry as a waiter For the past four and one-half years applicant worked as a quality control representative for Comcast in which he handled e2 80 9cescalations e2 80 9d; dealt with irate and demanding customers (over the phone) which call center employees could not deal with Some supervisory experience over the past six months with a Comcast affiliate    : Rates very high on our measures of conscientiousness Serious about his assignments and responsibilities Moderate needs for achievement, but high needs for competence and effectiveness Fairly active and energetic individual who prefers to remain busy and occupied Reliable, dependable, and consistent in his basic work habits; task-focused May over-extend himself at times in his attempts to assist coworkers who request his assistance; may be overly accommodating in this area    : Raised by a father who was a USMC Vietnam combat veteran; strict upbringing Indicated that the authority figures in his life have been well-intentioned in their discipline and expectations, with the exception of one boss who was a micromanager Follows the rules; will adhere to established policies and procedures Open and receptive to new ideas and constructive criticism; eager to learn Should adapt favorably to the structure and rigor of life within a paramilitary organization  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Confident and somewhat relaxed in his demeanor; does not come on strong Reliant upon tact and persuasiveness in dealing with confrontation and hostility Expected to hold his ground when his authority is challenged, but will need to improve upon his impact and the development of a more authoritative bearing Adept problem-solver; thinks quickly on his feet Expected to be firm and fair in his enforcement of laws and ordinances; by no means rigid or heavy-handed With the proper training and some experience under his belt this area may emerge as a strength for this individual    : Open and candid in discussing the regrets and disappointments he has had in his life Able to acknowledge his own contribution to problems and setbacks when they occurred Not likely to make excuses or blame others when problems arise or things do not go his way No brushes with law enforcement; denied any use of illicit substances in his life Recently divorced, this applicant is residing with his mother temporarily, but has established himself as an independent, responsible, and autonomous adult    : Stable, even-tempered, and relatively well-adjusted Talked about overcoming some significant obstacles and adversity in his life; appears to have done so in an adaptive manner Not prone toward prolonged periods of worry or depression Positive self-image; should be able to roll with the punches when faced with the negativity and resistance encountered in this line of work Small but supportive base of family and friends Enjoys a few recreational and social interests which help him to relax and blow off steam when necessary  Inexperienced in positions of enforcing rules and maintaining order other than his strong customer service background. While his customer service and collaborative supervisory skills will be helpful in this line of work, this individual will need to embolden his approach and develop his impact in enforcement situations. A bit of patience on the part of his FTO e2 80 99s and first-line supervisors may pay dividends down the road, as this applicant appears to possess the qualities and attributes to adapt to the enforcement side of the job. I    Average  (assesses cognitive abilities)    Spelling          s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Cahanin provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that was clear and definitive in his citation of detailed information. At times, Mr. Cahanin added a bit of elaboration which was helpful in clarifying his meaning and intent. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated average writing ability, as he consistently expressed himself in complete sentences, which generally contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. With a bit of guidance and mentoring, Mr. Cahanin should be able to produce informative and professional reports and documentation as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Cahanin to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his educational and occupational accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above. By his own admission, he has had a bit of difficulty in formal academic settings, and has not always applied himself to the best of his ability. A mechanically-inclined individual, this applicant prefers hands-on and experiential learning, but he did manage to achieve very good grades in obtaining his associate e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice from an on-line university in 2015. With respect to the position in question, Mr. Cahanin has the capacity to master the essential information and skills required to become a police officer.  The elder of two children, Mr. Cahanin spent most of his developmental years in Lindenhurst where he attended local public schools. Mr. Cahanin expressed much respect for his father who was a Vietnam combat veteran who also liked to party and drink to excess. Raised with solid morals and values by both parents, Mr. Cahanin e2 80 99s mother and father divorced when he was a junior in high school, which admittedly bothered him significantly over the next several years as he watched his father deteriorate until his untimely death in 2012. According to Mr. Cahanin, he has wanted to pursue a career in police work since he was in grade school, and he still keeps a miniature police cruiser on his desk which was given to him by a Lake County Sheriff e2 80 99s Deputy at a County Fair when he was in grade school. For a couple of reasons, he was never able to effectively launch himself into his vocation of choice until recently. Married for about 11 months to a woman he dated for four years prior, this marriage ended because of her aversion to relocating and supporting him in his endeavors to test for police jobs. In fact, he turned down an offer from the Wisconsin Highway Patrol in late 2017 because his wife refused to accompany him to his assigned area within the State. Since that time, he has redoubled his efforts to become a police officer in his hometown of Lindenhurst. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Cahanin to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question, as he received favorable ratings on all but one of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. Despite his lifelong desire to work in the law enforcement field, Mr. Cahanin e2 80 99s credentials and qualifications are not particularly impressive in terms of exposure and related experience. At the same time, he is a socially adept, altruistic, and hardworking individual who has the capacity master essential job functions if given the chance. While he will need to develop more of an authoritative bearing and command presence in certain situations, citizens will view him as a capable and sincere public servant. In light of our favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Cahanin be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Lindenhurst, Illinois. \"',\n",

Likable and considerate candidate; should be able to comfortably integrate into a new department rather quickly. I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Calero provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that was informative and detailed. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated average writing ability as he consistently demonstrated the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences, which contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. An experienced officer, we believe he has the capacity to produce professional and thorough reports and documents, and that he will be diligent in performing this essential job function. Despite his sub-par scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability, we evaluate Mr. Calero to possess at least average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his academic and occupational accomplishments to date, and by the manner in which he was able to express his thoughts and ideas (orally and on paper) during the course of his assessment. We are at a loss to explain Mr. Calero e2 80 99s below average scores on the Wonderlic, as he possesses an associate e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice from the College of DuPage (2007) and a bachelor e2 80 99s degree in business management from National-Louis University obtained in 2016. Most importantly, we were impressed with the level of his emotional and social intelligence, which we believe enhances his ability to master essential job functions in the actual performance of his duties as a police officer.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Calero to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question, as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. An engaging, likable, and respectful applicant, we anticipate that Mr. Calero should prove to be a well-regarded and rather popular officer within the department over time. With his experience with four police agencies Mr. Calero is looking for more opportunities to learn and develop in available specialty areas with hopes of one day being in a supervisory role. Although he has no complaints about his current position with the Mundelein PD over the past three years, Mr. Calero explained that Woodridge is much closer to his home and family in Naperville. In this regard, he has a one-year-old son with special needs, and he would like to apply that commuting time into more availability with his son, daughter, and wife. By his own admission, he could be more productive in writing tickets, yet we feel there is a lot to like about this sincere, mature, and well-intentioned applicant.

I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Centeno provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional life that contained essential details and a bit of elaboration when it was necessary. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated  writing ability, as he was able to consistently demonstrate his ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Mr. Centeno has the ability to produce professional and informative reports and documentation as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Centeno to possess slightly  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his academic and occupational accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. An  student throughout high school and college, Mr. Centeno also found time for extracurricular activities. c2 a0 An energetic and goal-oriented individual, Mr. Centeno admittedly \"does not like to fail.\" c2 a0 We also believe he is motivated by success and mastery. c2 a0 This fairly bright individual will not have difficulty mastering the essential information and skills required of a police officer.  Born in Puerto Rico, this bilingual (Spanish) applicant arrived in the U.S. with his parents a few months after he was born. Mr. Centeno spent his developmental years in Chicago where he attended local parochial schools. An only child, Mr. Centeno e2 80 99s parents divorced during his freshman year of high school, but the candidate has maintained positive relationships with both of them. During his high school years, he set his sights on a law enforcement career due to the influence of extended family members employed as officers for CPD. While studying criminal justice at UW-Platteville, this athletic individual became much more serious about his time in the weight room and competitive body building (which he referred to as men e2 80 99s physique training). About a year ago, he won an amateur competition in his weight class, and is considering competing professionally but is not quite sure about doing so. Nevertheless, this applicant is in very good physical condition, and finds the discipline and rigor of his weight training enjoyable and gratifying. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Centeno to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. This individual has very high (if not grandiose) needs for achievement, and appears to possess the drive and determination to obtain most of the objectives he sets for himself (with the possible exception of becoming FBI Director within his lifetime which he listed his ultimate career goal). This applicant is socially adept and deals with people in a polite and engaging manner. At times, he can be a bit too self-congratulatory about some of his accomplishments and abilities, which is in line with his competitive nature. However, we anticipate that he will be inoffensive and able to forge collaborative working relationships with his peers and superiors. In light of our review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Centeno be extended an offer of employment to serve as a Police Officer with the Schaumburg Police Department. \\'',\n",

Rather serious and businesslike. May need some encouragement to lighten up and laugh at times. I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Chavez provided a typed account of his personal and professional background which included essential details and a degree of elaboration when it was necessary. We also administered two other writing samples to Mr. Chavez. In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated average writing ability as he consistently demonstrated the ability to express himself in complete sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. We expect this fastidious applicant to produce professional and informative reports and documents as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Chavez to possess at least average mental ability despite his sub-par scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. With his first language being Spanish, we have found that individuals who learn English secondarily often struggle with standardized tests. Nevertheless, this individual obtained average to  grades during high school and college, and he also has demonstrated the ability to obtain licensure as a medic and certification as a BOF. All things considered, this determined applicant has the ability to master the essential information and skills required of a police officer.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Chavez to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. Upon graduating from Plainfield Central High School in 2008, Mr. Chavez stated that he had always dreamed of a job in the public safety field, preferably as a police officer. Attributing this desire to his earlier years growing up in a rough neighborhood in Chicago, Mr. Chavez has applied himself to better his skills and qualifications as a public servant. In this regard, Mr. Chavez explained that he became interested in the EMS coursework offered at Joliet Junior College where he was originally a criminal justice major. Reasoning that he could probably catch on more quickly with a fire service career, he went in that direction instead where he gained some valuable street experience as a medic in the south suburbs. However, when he finally obtained a career position with the NW Homer FPD last year, Mr. Chavez lamented that he simply did not like the 24/48 hour schedule and realized that he was not a very good fit for a fire service career after all. From all indications, the relationship between his former girlfriend and mother of his child have stabilized, and he came across as eager and enthusiastic to transition into law enforcement as his career of choice. While he has some developmental needs which we have documented in this report, Mr. Chavez should be able to master essential job functions with the proper training and further experience. In light of our review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Chavez be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Riverdale, Illinois. \"',\n",

Name: Nicholas Chism Position: Part-Time Firefighter Age: 24 Department: Fire Department Date: October 13, 2017     : Well-groomed for his appointment at our office Appropriately attired in a business suit and tie Offers a firm handshake Comes across as familiar Quips and intimations of humor give the impression that he can be a wiseacre    : Able to read people and their moods Tries to be accommodating and polite For example, made frequents use of the term, e2 80 9cyes, sir, e2 80 9d when talking to the psychologist Respects those with more experience Open and unlikely to hide his feelings Likes to call attention to himself in a group setting Will enjoy the give-and-take along with the camaraderie at the firehouse    : Claims to want to help people and serve the community On the other hand, a career in the fire service and emergency medicine will likely fuel this individual e2 80 99s exaggerated needs for variety and excitement Specifically, he is a thrill-seeker, as evidenced by his outside interests in riding fast motorcycles, playing shooter videogames, and binge drinking    : A.A.S. degree in fire science from McHenry Community College in 2015 EMT-B from McHenry Community College in 2012, and again in 2017 after letting his EMT-B license lapse B.O.F. from McHenry Community College in 2014 where he was sponsored by the Huntley Fire Department Exposure to emergencies and trauma limited to his clinical time during his EMT-B training    : Notable length of tenure at his current job with Costco, where he has been gainfully employed since May of 2013 Also spent several years working at a retail clothing chain in West Dundee, Illinois With high needs for variety and excitement, he might show signs of selective motivation towards tasks that are mundane or boring For example, performing certain chores related to cleaning and maintenance might need reminding Admits that he has been disciplined on no less than three separate occasions at Costco for tardiness; in particular, he overslept his shift by at least an hour    : Respects those in positions of authority Only termination came at a job where he was unable to give the number of hours requested by his manager Responds well to leadership by example Wants to feel respected by his superiors He does not want to be publicly reprimanded or be the object of disciplinary actions without sufficient evidence that he is at fault Sensitive to criticism and likely to become defensive when explaining his actions    : As noted, this individual has had limited exposure to emergencies and trauma, other than during his clinical time in the ER while working towards his EMT-B certification There is no reason to believe that this person will be unable to fulfill this part of the position in question According to the candidate, accidents and injuries are a part of life He himself has had plenty of trips to the ER due to his dangerous and thrill-seeking pursuits as a youngster and an adult    : As noted above, he is a thrill-seeker Recently, he was involved in a motorcycle accident while riding his e2 80 9ccrotch-rocket e2 80 9d between 80 and 90 miles an hour Admits to at least seven moving violations, mostly for speeding over the posted limit In addition, the candidate consumes alcohol to excess, downing between 10 and 12 drinks at least ten times a year Has recently returned home to live after a falling out with his roommate    : Binge drinking habits are likely to lead to an embarrassing and possibly career-ending DUI High needs for thrill and excitement will make the mundane parts of the job harder to tolerate In his behalf, he has managed his financial affairs responsibly so that he should not have any monetary worries However, as might be expected, all of his hobbies and outlets revolve around adventurous activities like snowboarding and playing shooter games via the Internet Special Training, Orientation & Concerns This individual has certain qualities that will be hard to change or modify While he is immature, outgrowing his high needs for variety and excitement is not realistic I Mental Ability  Norms for Firefighters          s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, they were very sparse. The candidate e2 80 99s lack of conscientiousness with regard to these materials only further serves to reinforce our concerns about his selective motivation. Paperwork and report writing are not activities that most people enjoy, especially those serving in active public safety roles. On the other hand, being able to complete forms that are accurate and thorough is very important when billing for medical services. Without careful and proper documentation, reimbursement of EMS activities becomes rather difficult. While Mr. Chism did reasonably well on , he fared poorly on the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Apprai Test. This latter score predicts for making quick judgments without taking the time to deliberate. This attribute is characteristic of candidates, like Mr. Chism, who are action-junkies. In his behalf, however, he does have a college degree, and overall, we evaluate Mr. Chism to possess an acceptable level of mental ability as it pertains to the position in question. In sum, he is capable of learning the essential elements of the job.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Chism to be a less than acceptable applicant for the position in question. While we realize that the job itself is part-time, we are worried about this individual based on our findings as presented in I and III of this report. Mr. Chism has not demonstrated the kind of maturity and judgment necessary for such a critical public safety position. For example, he drinks to excess and has put himself and others in danger by recklessly riding his high-speed motorcycle. Even the applicant admits that after his most recent motorcycle accident at between 80 and 90 miles per hour, if he hit someone or something, he would not be alive today. Drinking 10 to 12 drinks on multiple occasions each year is also irresponsible. While we admire the applicant e2 80 99s longevity at his past and present places of work, we do not see him as ready for the role. Even with his good work record, he has been reprimanded for tardiness on several occasions. In addition, Mr. Chism allowed his EMT-B license to lapse despite his interest in pursuing a career in fire science and emergency medicine. Therefore, in light of our highly cautious review of this candidate, we would not recommend that Mr. Chism be given an offer to work as a Part-Time Firefighter for the Algonquin-Lake in the Hills FPD. \"',\n",

Name: Nicholas Chism Position: Firefighter Age: 26 Department: Fire Department Date: November 13, 2019     : Conscientious about the testing process, followed instructions well, and worked within the expressed timelines, even with short notice for his assessment Punctual, arrived 30 minutes early his assessment Well-groomed for his appointment at our office Appropriately attired in a business suit and tie Offers a firm handshake Sought to make a favorable     : Energetic, tends to be rather talkative, but not to the point where he seeks to be the center of attention in a group setting Tries to be accommodating and polite Respects those with more experience in the fire service, but can be critical of coworkers e2 80 93 no matter how experienced e2 80 93 who do not do their jobs properly As such, he is open and unlikely to hide his feelings Will enjoy the give-and-take along with the camaraderie at the firehouse Appreciates the fire service as it provides him with an opportunity to be part of a team    : Has enjoyed helping people and serving the community and he scored quite how on our measures of altruism The applicant is attracted to the opportunity to work with his hands, which is part of the job On the other hand, a career in the fire service and emergency medicine will likely fuel this individual e2 80 99s needs for variety and excitement Earlier in his life, he engaged in thrill-seeking activities, such as riding fast motorcycles and binge drinking At present, however, his priorities are focused and more mature    : A.A.S. degree in fire science from McHenry Community College in 2015 EMT-B from McHenry Community College in 2012, and again in 2017 after letting his EMT-B license lapse B.O.F. from McHenry Community College in 2014 where he was sponsored by the Huntley Fire Department Earned his paramedic e2 80 99s license just this year from Harper College and Northwest Community Hospital Since April of 2018, this person has been employed as a firefighter/paramedic with the Barrington Countryside Fire Protection District    : Notable length of tenure at Costco, where he was gainfully employed from May of 2013 until August of 2018 Also spent several years working at a retail clothing chain in West Dundee, Illinois Although his time at the Barrington Countryside Fire Protection District has been shorter, he has amassed a fairly decent work record with the exception of one write-up last year for oversleeping his alarm and arriving approximately 15 minutes late for his shift With high needs for variety and excitement, he might show signs of selective motivation towards tasks that are mundane or boring For example, he might need reminding about performing certain chores related to cleaning and maintenance along with repetitious training drills    : Respects those in positions of authority Only termination came at a job where he was unable to give the number of hours requested by his manager Responds well to leadership by example Wants to feel respected by his superiors Does not want to be publicly reprimanded or be the object of disciplinary actions without sufficient evidence that he is at fault Sensitive to criticism and might become defensive when explaining his actions    : In the year and a half that he has been part of the Barrington Countryside Fire Protection District, his department has afforded him a limited amount of exposure to emergencies and trauma In particular, the Barrington Countryside Fire Protection District runs about 2000 calls a year out of two station locations At the same time, he has witnessed a number of full arrests, most of which resulted in fatalities Has handled some trauma cases, but nothing of major consequence Regardless of his department e2 80 99s low call volume, there is no reason to believe that this person will be unable to fulfill this part of the position in question According to the candidate, accidents and injuries are a part of life With the proper training and some life experience and maturity under his belt we expect this applicant e2 80 99s skills in this area to gradually improve over time    : Earlier in his life the applicant was a thrill-seeker He was involved in a motorcycle accident several years ago while riding his motorcycle at close to 70 miles per hour on the entrance ramp to a major state highway The applicant lacked maturity in his early adulthood; the above-mentioned accident, plus at least seven moving violations, mostly for speeding over the posted limit, speaks to his need for excitement and immaturity We believe that the motorcycle accident, where he escaped serious injury, helped turn his life around as he realized that the other members of his immediate family would be adversely impacted by his injury or death Came across as open and honest in discussing some of the regrets and disappointments he has had in his life thus far Recently purchased his own townhouse with money he saved for a large down payment, and he is currently living alone    : High needs for variety and excitement will make the mundane parts of the job harder to tolerate On the other hand, he shows no signs of job burn-out as a member of the fire service and EMS To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he has curbed his binge drinking habits, realizing that such behavior could lead to an embarrassing and possibly career-ending DUI In his behalf, he has managed his financial affairs responsibly so he should not have any monetary worries Much of his spare time is now devoted to assisting his stepfather with building his small, garage door repair business Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Monitoring of his attitude at the fire station to make sure that he does not show signs of selective motivation, especially when performing routine chores or participating in repetitive training drills I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Chism submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate and provided sufficient detail and information. In addition, Mr. Chism used the proper spelling and grammar. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career. The applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability, and in particular, Mr. Chism gave a lot of background detail and information while employing appropriate grammar and syntax. The above-reported scores on  are heartening and predict positively for the applicant e2 80 99s ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate has demonstrated an acceptable amount of emotional intelligence. For example, he has been able to show empathy toward patients and the members of their families, and he has been able to learn and grow from past mistakes.  Based on this person e2 80 99s behavior while a teenager and into his early twenties, we would have been reluctant to appoint him to such a responsible role in the fire service and EMS. In particular, he failed to demonstrate the kind of maturity and judgment necessary for such a critical public safety position. For example, he drank to excess and put himself as well as others in danger by recklessly riding his high-speed motorcycle and speeding in his automobile. The applicant acknowledged that after his motorcycle accident the outcome could have been much worse, and he would not be alive today. The accident occurred the day after his birthday, and when his older sister came to visit him in the hospital, she told him that while the day before was his birthday, the day afterwards could have been his funeral. Realizing that he recklessly placed both his career and his life in jeopardy, Mr. Chism began a long, but steady climb upward to where today he is ready to assume a more responsible role in the fire service and EMS. We admire the applicant e2 80 99s longevity at his past and present places of work, and that does speak to loyalty and longevity for a future employer. Accommodating, polite, and respectful of those individuals with more experience, most people will enjoy having him as part of the team. He has been able to learn from past mistakes and refocus his energy and effort into more productive outlets. This kind of a behavior, along with earning the proper licenses and certifications, is a very good basis for building a successful career as a firefighter/paramedic. Nevertheless, we will defer to the Board of Police and Fire Commissioners for the Village of Skokie to arrive at a final decision on Mr. Chism e2 80 99s suitability for hire with the Skokie Fire Department. \"',\n",

shows few signs of emotion and fewer signs of a sense of humor Will be perceived as straightforward and direct; rather matter-of-fact in his dealings with other people When asked about his serious-minded demeanor, the applicant relied that he is about to enter e2 80 9ca serious-minded line of work e2 80 9d    : Values hard work and dedication to one e2 80 99s family; wants to keep people and property safe Seeks to be a reliable and dependable resource for his family and the community In short, he wants to be seen as a role-model Although he does not exude much warmth, he will treat others with respect and equanimity as long as they reciprocate those same qualities Aware of the pressures of the job, to include shiftwork, but has operated under similar conditions in other roles and is not concerned by the challenge  relevant work and life experience  : Some valuable customer service experience as a passenger service assistant for Prospect Airport Services between 2011 and 2013 Also has customer service as well as supervisory experience while spending six months working at a Menards after leaving Prospect Airport Services Hired by the TSA in March of 2014 as a Transportation Security Officer; still currently employed, and has enjoyed his opportunities to provide passenger safety Bachelor e2 80 99s degree in computer information systems from DeVry University (2013)    : Very punctual individual as evidenced by his early arrival for his appointment at our offices Takes pride in his hard work and meeting expectations Readily volunteers for overtime Does not cut corners or skip over procedures, no matter how minor Claims he has been sick only seven days in the five years working for the TSA Overall, rates exceptionally high on our measures of conscientiousness, to include his willingness to follow and obey the rules    : As noted above, the applicant can be expected to take direction from command staff Takes his job seriously and expects the same from his supervisors and coworkers alike Responds well to a supportive supervisor, who will take his side when justified Appreciates a supervisor who is approachable and willing to listen to his questions and concerns Not surprisingly, he has never been terminated from any previous place of work  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Not overtly compassionate or emotional, but will be considerate and respectful to citizens Stated preference is to follow the rules and maintain integrity Will administer the laws and ordinances of the community in a by-the-book manner Likely to experience difficulty recognizing circumstances and situations which call for flexibility or showing a reasonable degree of leniency This person would benefit from showing a more approachable presence, beginning with learning to smile more frequently    : Came to this country as a teenager and had to adapt quickly to his new surroundings Has exercised mature judgment; highly responsible Reports no arrests, to include no moving violations or traffic tickets The candidate claims that he has tried marijuana only once, at age 23, and never used the substance again Recently married and his wife is expecting Stays with his jobs, respects authority, follows the rules, and makes sure that his integrity is maintained    : Demonstrated resiliency when he immigrated to this country and was forced to learn a new language and make a totally new group of friends The candidate e2 80 99s five years of employment with the TSA is commendable Has a number of healthy outlets to relieve tension and stress For example, he exercises five times a week, maintains and enjoys his home aquarium, and plays video games Appears to have no harmful habits which might impair his ability to perform the job in question; reports consuming alcohol in moderation and only on special occasions  Coaching on projecting a friendlier and more approachable police presence Monitoring his routine citizen interactions to make sure that he demonstrates the proper flexibility and leniency I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Chodorowski provided the appropriate amount of information regarding his personal and professional background on our Personal History Form. This candidate cuts right to the point and did not tend to elaborate much in his written material. Mr. Chodorowski was much more open and willing to divulge information about himself during his face-to-face interview at our offices. Mr. Chodorowski was administered two other writing exercises, and he was generally attentive to using proper grammar and writing mechanics, although at times it was noticeable that he is not a native English speaker. The candidate learned English as a second language, as his family emigrated from Poland to the United States when he was sixteen. That being said, we believe Mr. Chodorowski has a very good grasp on the meaning behind words and actions. It is worth noting that his score on the verbal portion of  shown above, is below the recommended level of performance for police officers. Regardless, it is hard to imagine this candidate slacking off or making light of a critical situation, and thus we think he will put forth the necessary effort in order to produce professional and thorough documentation and police reports when vested with those responsibilities. In relation to the position in question, we evaluate Mr. Chodorowski to have slightly  mental ability along with the determination and will to learn and perform the required duties.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Chodorowski to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. As we noted, the candidate came to this country as a teenager along with his mother. Settling on the northwest side of the City of Chicago and attending Taft High School, Mr. Chodorowski was forced to establish new friendships and master a totally new language. To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, Mr. Chodorowski proved himself to be a very good student in earning  grades. Although the applicant majored in computer science in college at DeVry University, where he was awarded a bachelor e2 80 99s degree in 2013, he has always set his sights on a career in law enforcement. Toward that end, he has gained valuable job-related experience as a Transportation Security Officer with the TSA at O e2 80 99Hare International Airport in Terminal One. As our report states, Mr. Chodorowski has been a model employee by demonstrating his work ethic, punctuality, and commitment to his job. In sum, he is a dependable person overall. On the other hand, this person e2 80 99s projects a serious demeanor that mitigates his being seen as an approachable police presence. We expect that Mr. Chodorowski will likely administer the Village e2 80 99s laws and ordinances in a by-the-book fashion, showing little leniency or flexibility. These areas should be addressed directly by his FTO e2 80 99s during the applicant e2 80 99s probationary period. Nevertheless, in light of our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Chodorowski be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Schaumburg. \"',\n",

at times incomprehensible Came across as open and engaging; tried to manage his impression as best he could Concerns about this applicant e2 80 99s perceived credibility and preparedness on the part of citizens    : Moderately outgoing and generally agreeable individual with a strong sense of teamwork and brotherhood At the same time, he has low needs for inclusion and acceptance from others; may be a bit more isolative than he would care to admit Seemed sincere and well-intentioned; polite and respectful Expected to be loyal and supportive of his coworkers, but may not always volunteer to cover shifts or accommodate duty trades    : Scored  on our measures of altruism During his high school years he reported volunteering to assist other special education students in his classes Applicant has served his country and worked in public safety the majority of his working life Feels good about himself when he is able to make a positive impact on the lives of others Nevertheless, this applicant is primarily drawn to the stability, security, benefits, and schedule associated with a career firefighting position Maintained that he wanted a set e2 80 9cshedual e2 80 9d so he could focus on his many hobbies; overall came across as more preoccupied with his personal needs for comfort and convenience    : Reportedly holds an associate e2 80 99s degree in e2 80 9cgeneral studys e2 80 9d from Harper College which took him nine years to obtain Began a baccalaureate program designed by Southern Illinois University through JJC three years ago, but is no longer currently enrolled Served as an Army Ranger and Advanced Tactical Practitioner (medic) for four years; one four-month deployment to Afghanistan Employed by a e2 80 9cprivet e2 80 9d fire district (Elk Grove Township) from 2015 to 2018; stated he served as an acting officer periodically Currently working part-time at the Wauconda FPD since September of 2018 Certified as an FAE and BOF in 2015; licensed as a paramedic in 2013    : Underachiever with variable self-discipline; will apply himself when it is absolutely necessary Disorganized, unfocused, and careless in his work habits as implied by recent reprimands for forgetting equipment on scene, rolling stop signs in department vehicles, etc. Ironically, candidate views himself as very organized and well-prepared; that does not appear to be the case throughout the course of his academic and professional life Demoted in rank from E-4 to E-1 in the Army toward the end of his enlistment for a DUI charge off-base near Fort Benning, Georgia Was required to take his tactical practitioner course three times before he eventually passed it during his Ranger training Selectively motivated individual, but has very high needs for achievement and advancement Lacks the conscientiousness and focus to obtain the lofty goals he sets for himself    : Respectful and accommodating in his interactions with those in positions of authority Will comply with direct orders and will adhere to departmental policies and guidelines most of the time At the same time, he will require a great deal of oversight and external motivation to complete assigned tasks competently Quick to admit to faults and shortcomings, but does little to correct them or improve himself Seeks a union department in part because he would like representation when he feels he has been treated unfairly    : Appears to have functioned capably in some high-stress situations especially during his four-month tenure in a combat zone in the military Although he reportedly functions as an acting officer with EGTFPD at times, we have concerns about his judgment and decision-making based upon his history and test results Probably functions at his best during emergencies and critical situations; may lack same initiative and motivation with routine calls In addition, this candidate did not strike us as very circumspect prior to taking action; can be rather impulsive Does appear to have a compassionate bedside manner with patients    : Very candid and open in reporting regrets and disappointments in his life Acknowledged his own contribution to setbacks and mistakes, but has done little to correct them Married for the past month to a woman he met on-line five years ago; this relationship seems to have provided him with the sense of security and stability he was lacking intermittently over the years Earlier in his life, he was cited for an underage drinking ticket and also had his driving privileges suspended for one year in 2009 for three moving violations in one year We mentioned previously that he was demoted in rank three pay grades in 2013 for driving under the influence while he was still in the military; it is not known if his driving privileges were suspended after that charge Recently purchased his first home one week ago; eager to feel like a stable and responsible citizen once he obtains a career firefighter position    : Insecure individual who appears to have struggled with feelings of inferiority throughout his life Tried to compensate for these dynamics by pursuing careers in the mixed martial arts and special forces training in the military Able to cope with the more traumatic and gruesome aspects of life in the fire service Will struggle with the discipline, expectations, and dedication inherent in a progressive and well-regarded fire department in terms of his productivity and initiative which will bother him Although he seems rather agreeable and gregarious, he is actually rather private; spends most of his free time with his wife and dogs Special Training, Orientation & Concerns This applicant presents numerous concerns and potential difficulties that are not likely to be remedied or improved with training or education as they involve deep-rooted personality characteristics which are not likely to change much over time. As such, we will defer on any specific recommendations or suggestions at this time. The aforementioned reservations and concerns are documented throughout this report. I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, this candidate provided a garbled assemblage of facts and responses which were incomplete or difficult to decipher due to his poor writing skills and atrocious spelling and grammar. Overall, this applicant e2 80 99s ability to effectively express himself on paper does not approximate what we would expect for a person with a college degree. Not only will he dislike paperwork and report writing and documentation, this individual will have a great deal of trouble producing professional and informative reports as a firefighter and medic. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Cirrincione to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported by some of his occupational accomplishments to date and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. Mr. Cirrincione gave a rather confusing account of his educational background, as he stated that he graduated from Lake Park West High School in 2005 with a 4.00 (5.00 scale) GPA. At the same time, he stated that he was unfocused and did not apply himself which he attributed to an undiagnosed attention deficit disorder which he claims has interfered with his academic odyssey over the past 14 years. He has never received any treatment or medication for this problem, but did mention that he was placed in a special education classroom for part of his high school years. While it was not mentioned by Mr. Cirrincione, he presented some symptomatic features of dyslexia or perhaps another type of language-based learning disability which would require much more extensive testing and diagnosis to determine. As he did several times throughout his interview, Mr. Cirrincione hung his head and stated that he was e2 80 9cimmature, undisciplined, and irresponsible e2 80 9d for long intervals during his attempts to complete a college degree and his military training, attributing his poor academic grades to not applying himself and his reported e2 80 9cattention deficit. e2 80 9d On his behalf, Mr. Cirrincione eventually obtained his associate e2 80 99s degree in e2 80 9cgeneral studys e2 80 9d from Harper College over the course of nine years of trying. Mr. Cirrincione also indicated that he is pursuing his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in emergency management from SIU, but when questioned about his status with that endeavor, he admitted that he has not taken anything other than a couple of introductory courses e2 80 9ca couple of years ago. e2 80 9d In summation, Mr. Cirrincione has already demonstrated his ability to function as a firefighter and paramedic based upon his experiences and basic certifications. We rather doubt that he will apply himself toward the attainment of advanced fire service certifications unless he is under the gun to do so or there is some matter of personal gain in it for him.  Mr. Cirrincione is the youngest of three children who spent his developmental years in Roselle where he attended local public schools. Upon graduating from high school, Mr. Cirrincione maintained that his goal was to become a firefighter after being a member of the Roselle FD Explorers Post for a couple of years. At the same time, his primary interest was to become a professional mixed martial arts fighter. After not faring well his first semester in college, he invested all of his money in order to move to Memphis to receive additional training and experience in MMA, which never materialized because the school closed after a year. Returning home, he struggled to attend classes at Harper College for about four years and eventually dropped out to join the Army where he pursued Special Forces training and completed training as a combat medic with an Army Ranger unit. Since his discharge at the rank of E-2, Mr. Cirrincione began pursuing his academics with a bit more focus and energy toward becoming a civilian fire-medic. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Cirrincione to be an unacceptable applicant for the position in question as he received unfavorable ratings on most of the key dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. Although he is a rather likable and mild-mannered individual, who has achieved some significant accomplishments in his life, he has also had his share of failures and disappointments which in some ways undermined his achievements. Some examples of these latter experiences are his demotion in rank in the Army, his difficulty getting through advanced individual tactical practitioner training, and his eventual decision to end his tour of duty after four years. The same can be said about his academic endeavors, which have been variable and erratic in terms of focus and application. Coupled with his encompassing focus on obtaining a career position because of the schedule, benefits, and stability he anticipates with a union department, Mr. Cirrincione did not strike us as very dedicated to serving and protecting the community. We believe this erratic individual will be a handful to monitor and supervise even though he may be consistent and reliable in his basic work habits (like showing up on time and performing required job functions after being told to do so). In light of our many concerns and reservations, we would not recommend that Mr. Cirrincione be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Mount Prospect, Illinois. \"',\n",

Because the report may contain certain developmental recommendations or special cautions concerning an applicant, we advise that only those managers involved in the supervision of the individual have access to the report. Human Resources professionals involved in hiring decisions may also need to review the reports. Under no circumstances should the information or contents of this report be shared with the applicant unless under the direct supervision of a trained psychologist. We recommend that this report be considered valid for one year. While many of the characteristics of the applicant will not change significantly during that time, others may change enough to alter an individual\\'s qualifications (e.g. , maturation, personal circumstances). Personality does change over periods of time as a result of life experiences, successes and failures over the course of life, and major life events and traumas. In the case of public safety candidates, the exposure to tragic, traumatic, and emotionally charged events in the line of duty, coupled with the need for a quick adaptation to a paramilitary culture predicts for an increased likelihood of adjustment difficulties and possible personality changes quicker than other professions. Moreover, because of the unique combination of skills required for each position, this report pertains to the job in question, only.

Name: Ljiljana Clampit Position: Police Officer Age: 22 Department: Police Department Date: May 31, 2019     : Well-groomed and professionally attired in a suit for her appointment at our office Straightforward, yet easy to engage in conversation Talkative at first, which she attributed to her feeling nervous to be evaluated; she also blushed in the beginning of the evaluation Will likely be seen as approachable as well as credible by members of the public    : Listens well; this reliable team player should fit in well with a new department Aware and dependable; assesses situations before reacting to them, including ones that are social in nature Gets along well with coworkers This candidate is likely to contribute to positive team morale and would rather not work with someone who is negative According to her, co-workers would describe her as dedicated, hard working, and empathetic; we believe these descriptions to be true based on our observations    : Comes across as committed and altruistic in her desire to help the public Raised by her parents to value respect and working hard; she takes pride in doing just that and intends to use these qualities to ensure community safety Genuinely wants to improve the safety of the public and looks forward to working within the community Enjoys working in a job that offers variety; appreciates that every day will not be the same  relevant work and life experience  : Earned an associate e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice from the College of DuPage (2017) and a bachelor e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice from Lewis University (2018) Since January of 2019, she has worked as a community service officer at Morton Grove Police Department and as a police assistant for Rolling Meadows Police Department Prior to her current positions, she was a community service officer for the Berkeley Police Department (12/2017 to 5/2019) and a parking enforcement officer for the Forest Park Police Department (6/2018 to 1/2019) Diligently learned the ins and outs of paperwork, procedures, and what will be expected of her as a police officer    : This hardworking individual will be seen as motivated and helpful in a department; she presently works approximately 60 hours a week Motivated to pursue her goals; she was raised to value working for what she has Not afraid of jumping in and helping when a job needs to get done According to the candidate, it is extremely rare for her to show up late or take sick days Possess the discipline to take time and get a job done well; she does not hesitate to figure things out on her own when it is appropriate to do so    : Proven ability to adapt to a paramilitary setting as a community service officer in multiple departments; her transition to a full-time officer should be relatively easy for her It should be noted that her boyfriend of a year and a half is a police officer; she started dating him when she was a community service officer at Berkeley On that note, immediately after they started dating, she disclosed their relationship status to the chief to ensure her behaviors were aligned with the department e2 80 99s policies Prefers working with a supervisor who leads by example and is respectable No reported history of terminations or disciplinary actions  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Will employ compassion and tact when enforcing rules in the public With the proper training, we believe she will overcome her initial nervousness and be able to respond to emergencies with good judgment and tact She has been able to enforce minor rules in her past and present positions, though she will likely need some assertiveness training to improve in this area We expect this candidate e2 80 99s skills to improve considerably overtime in this dimension as she grows and matures on the job    : Appears more mature than her stated age; from all indications this candidate began assuming responsibility for herself and her actions at an early age She accepts responsibility in an honest and straightforward fashion; it is unlikely that there will be any surprises with this person No history of arrests or experimentation with illegal drugs; she has an allergy to alcohol Reasonable amount of unpaid financial obligations all related to student loans Followed the rules throughout her life; takes pride in being responsible and studious    : This resilient individual has seen her fair share of stressful situations Her maturity and common sense will serve her well in confronting stress as an officer Family is very important to this candidate; she also gets strong support from her close group of long-term friends and boyfriend, who is a police officer To relax outside of work, this athletic individual engages in ju-jitsu, tap dancing, boxing, and playing with her dog  She will benefit from assertiveness training and learning when to stand her ground and be firm when necessary. This candidate is inexperienced when it comes to police work; she will need some time to acclimate to being a police officer, but we expect her to be a quick study. I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, she diligently completed all of the required paperwork. Ms. Clampit filled out her Personal History Form with attention to detail and care. Ms. Clampit was articulate in both written and verbal forms of communication. We also administered two other writing samples, and in all exercises, this applicant demonstrated strong writing ability. Overall, we expect her reports to be professional and adequate, especially when she receives training and understands what is expected in terms of paperwork. As noted above, Ms. Clampit scored well above the recommended competency level on both the verbal and quantitative ability portions on our standardized test. This candidate will be able to rely on her  intelligence when she is learning to write reports and complete the paperwork necessary for the position in question. Ms. Clampit appears to be very bright; she has always excelled in school and considers herself e2 80 9cstudious. e2 80 9d As a result of her intellectual abilities, she should catch on to the job duties quite fast and be able to perform to the department e2 80 99s standards.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Clampit to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. Ms. Clampit currently resides in Villa Park, Illinois, where she was born and raised. The candidate e2 80 99s mother emigrated from Serbia and instilled values in Ms. Clampit that have encouraged her to work hard and not give up on her goals. Ms. Clampit remembers wanting to pursue a law enforcement career from a very young age. Once this candidate commits to something, she does not quit easily. This likeable individual is not afraid of working hard and is eager to please her superiors in order to learn how to perform the job duties of a police officer to the best of her ability. Ms. Clampit has a strong sense of character and is a caring and altruistic person. At the same time, she may be perceived as a bit nervous upon first meeting her. Her peers and superiors will definitely notice this candidate e2 80 99s steadfast and dependable work habits. Though she is only 22 years old, her wisdom and empathy make her appear older than her actual age. Once she has been properly trained, we anticipate that she will develop into a competent and capable addition to the department. In light of our review, we would recommend that Ms. Clampit be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Bloomingdale. ERL/\"',\n",

Name: Richard Cruise Position: Firefighter Age: 25 Department: Fire Department Date: April 5, 2019     : Neatly groomed and attired in a suit and tie; professional and respectful presentation Pleasant, down-to-earth, and open in his demeanor; not many pretenses about this individual Came across as honest, straightforward, and mild-mannered Will be able to project an approachable and mature presence as a firefighter and medic    : A likable and sincere individual, this applicant has a very large number of close and trusted friends At the same time, he is by no means e2 80 9cthe life of the party e2 80 9d; moderately outgoing, considerate, and positive in his interpersonal style Background in competitive sports; stand-up guy and collaborative team player Should not encounter much difficulty forging comfortable and dependable working relationships with his peers and superiors    : Scored very high on our measures of altruism Self-esteem enhanced when he is able to make a positive impact on the lives of others Will be respectful and courteous in his interactions with citizens He is also drawn to the camaraderie, teamwork, and mission orientation of a fire service career    : Holds two associate e2 80 99s degrees; one in fire science and the other in emergency medical services; both earned in 2015 Licensed as a paramedic in 2016; several advanced EMS certifications Certified as a BOF in 2018 Applicant has been serving his hometown (Shabbona) volunteer fire department since 2011 Since October of 2017 the applicant has been employed as a contract paramedic with the Lale Fire Department; only ambulance duties    : Rates high on our measures of conscientiousness Serious about his duties and responsibilities Major criticism he has received from previous supervisors is that he may take on e2 80 9ctoo much e2 80 9d at times; humbly reported e2 80 9cI never say no e2 80 9d Reliable, dependable, and energetic in his basic work habits Expected to arrive early and stay late in order to accomplish all that is expected of him and more    : Beginning with his parents and extended family members, this applicant was raised with a healthy respect for those in positions of power and authority over him Will be polite, accommodating, and respectful in his interactions with superiors At the same time, he will pose questions when he is uncertain or confused about what is expected of him in terms of procedures and guidelines Follows the rules; will adhere to departmental policies and procedures Open and receptive to constructive criticism; eager to learn    : Calm and even-keeled in his demeanor; exudes a modest sense of self-assurance Over the past eight years in fire service related jobs, this individual has been able to maintain his poise and composure under pressure Well-prepared and reasonably assertive; will take initiative in areas within his range of competence and expertise With continued training and a bit more experience under his belt, we expect this dimension to emerge as a strength for this applicant    : Although he still resides with his parents at the age of 25, this applicant has taken several steps to establish himself as an independent and autonomous adult Consistently employed in some capacity since his early high school years Open and candid about his shortcomings and weaknesses Able to acknowledge his own contribution to setbacks and problems when they occurred Has never had one drop of alcohol in his life; no brushes with law enforcement    : Stable, level-headed, and relatively well-adjusted Not easily rattled, angered, or frustrated Does not experience prolonged periods of worry or depression Optimistic and proactive approach to life and career Large number of close friends and associates; supportive extended family Not expected to encounter difficulty coping with the more traumatic and gruesome aspects of life in the fire service Special Training, Orientation & Concerns This applicant has not spent much time away from his small town, central Illinois roots, but is eager to experience what life and the fire service is like away from his rural surroundings. We do not consider this to be a difficult transition for him, as he is bright, determined, and tends to catch on quickly. Nevertheless, some of his fellow firefighters may find him to be a bit rustic and na c3 afve initially. I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Cruise provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background which included essential details and a degree of elaboration when it was appropriate. In the other two written exercises he was administered, Mr. Cruise demonstrated the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Mr. Cruise is fully capable of producing professional and informative reports and documents. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Cruise to possess  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his grades throughout high school and college, and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. An  student at a small rural high school, Mr. Cruise was a three-sport athlete, and he also worked part-time. As part of his high school curriculum, he spent two years at a technical campus taking criminal justice coursework. Due to the suicide of his beloved uncle who served in Iraq and functioned as a police officer, Mr. Cruise abruptly changed his career focus to the fire service with some encouragement to do so from his parents. To date, he has earned two associate e2 80 99s degrees in fire science and EMS respectively. A determined and fairly bright young man, Mr. Cruise is not expected to have difficulty obtaining advanced fire service certifications.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Cruise to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. During his interview, this applicant came across as enthusiastic and optimistic about connecting with a much larger and well-respected fire department where he feels he will be properly trained and given a fair chance at advancement and specialization when he is deemed ready. Growing up in a rural community, Mr. Cruise was especially impressed with Chief Haigh e2 80 99s orientation address to new applicants in which the Chief emphasized that he e2 80 9cwants to know every firefighter e2 80 99s family, the names of their children, and where they want to go with their careers. e2 80 9d Mr. Cruise stated he was a bit shocked to hear those words, as he had never heard anything like that from any of his Chief officers previously. The family atmosphere, camaraderie, and professionalism of Hanover Park Fire is very appealing to him. On the other hand, there may be another consideration with this applicant involving geography due to the commute he will have to make from Shabbona to Hanover Park if hired. Involved in a committed relationship to an elementary education major at Aurora University, this applicant has no set plans to relocate anytime soon. Although he seemed earnest in stating this travel time would not be problematic for him, that remains to be seen. Nevertheless, our assessment indicates that Mr. Cruise is a friendly, hardworking, and rather ambitious recruit who will fit in well with the personnel at HPFD. In light of our review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Cruise be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Hanover Park. \"',\n",

Name: Kevin Day Position: Firefighter Age: 28 Department: Fire Department Date: June 6, 2019     : Exceptionally clean-cut individual with closely cropped hair Appropriately attired in a suit and tie for his appointment at our office The candidate comes as across confident and composed Overall, he will project a professional image as a member of the fire service    : A quiet person who prefers to let his achievements speak for him While colleagues will see this candidate as serious-minded, overall, he is a genuinely friendly and approachable person Peers will eventually perceive him as pleasant and polite There is a straightforward and sincere quality to the candidate, which will allow him to deal with others in an honest fashion When faced with coworkers who refuse to pull their own weight, he will try to inspire them through leading by his own example of hard work    : The opportunity to stay physically active is what appeals most to the applicant about having a career in the fire service and emergency medicine For example, he does not want to be confined to an office all day long Appreciates the chance to help people Sees firefighters as serving as role models for the members of the community Seeks a profession that will hold him to a higher standard    : No formal degree in fire science, yet obtained his EMT-B in 2008 through Christ Advocate Hospital and Moraine Valley Community College During his time at the hospital he witnessed several serious injuries from stabbings to gunshot wounds No practical experience with fire suppression Most his jobs have been hands-on and service-oriented; has worked in maintenance at local college for over four years; prior to that he worked for a golf course    : Lengthy tenure working as a maintenance worker for Governors State University; has been steadily employed there since February of 2015 This individual is hardworking, and he will be quick to demonstrate initiative Likes to have his quality of work and results speak for him At the same time, the candidate has been criticized for not being vocal enough to promote himself or speak up when bothered by something at work    : Raised with a strong set of values, to include respect for those in positions of authority Never been arrested Never been terminated or disciplined by any employer Wants to feel respected by his superiors since he is quick to respect them Performs best with clear communication Fairness is important to the applicant as he expects everyone to be held to the same set of high standards    : We found no evidence indicating that this individual will be able to handle himself in a focused and calm manner when facing emergency situations As stated earlier in our findings, we observed the candidate to be a composed individual Besides his tour in the ER and ride time during his EMT training, his exposure to emergencies and trauma has been limited Once he has completed further training and development in fire suppression and EMS, we believe this candidate will improve in this area with time and experience    : The youngest of three sons, both he and his siblings were well-behaved and required little disciplining and oversight from their parents Admits to using marijuana a handful of times, with his last usage of the substance being four years ago (around 2015) Married for the last two years; his wife has a responsible job as a capital markets underwriter The couple rent their home and only have a car loan around $25,000 as outstanding debt, as they seem to live comfortably within their means    : With his relatively calm and composed temperament, this person is unlikely to allow stress and tension to derail him in his career in the fire service In short, this very little that perturbs this person For relief and relaxation, this applicant engages in athletic activities, primarily with his wife, who he initially met while playing tennis Appears to have no harmful habits which would impair his ability to handle the demands of the job Claims his consumption of alcohol is limited to three or four drinks at most over the course of an evening Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Additional training in fire suppression and EMS since, to date, he only has earned his EMT-B I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Day supplied detailed and accurate information regarding his personal and professional history. On our written exercise asking candidates to explain a highlight and setback of their lives, Mr. Day did an excellent job of elaborating on these incidents. We are not surprised by his attention to detail as he is gifted with a solid work ethic. The candidate also rates highly on our measures of conscientiousness, and in particular, his sense of self-discipline along with his willingness to follow the rules. This kind of behavior bodes well for preparing paperwork and reports required by the position in question, especially pertaining to the reimbursement of medical expenses for services rendered by the department. Mr. Day reports having outstanding grades throughout high school and college while also engaged in many extracurricular activities and sports. His scores on  administered at our offices confirm what is quite evident by looking through Mr. Day e2 80 99s educational and professional accomplishments. This college graduate should have little, if any, trouble learning and mastering the essential elements of the job in question. Finally, we observed Mr. Day to be both empathetic and compassionate, which predicts positively for interacting with patients during medical emergencies.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Day to be an acceptable candidate for the position in question. As our report reads, there is a lot to like about the applicant. Mr. Day claims that he has had an interest in the fire service since high school. However, the applicant admits that his true intention for enrolling in college was to play varsity baseball. Toward that end, he enrolled in a community college in Iowa that was known for its baseball program. The applicant was a three-sport athlete at Plano High School, and he has always excelled in athletics. After earning a degree in general studies through Northern Illinois University in December of 2014, Mr. Day tested for the Aurora Fire Department, realizing that athletics would never be a realistic long-term career for him. After failing to land a job in Aurora, Mr. Day went to work in a variety of jobs. Most recently, he has been performing maintenance work at Governors State University, a role that he enjoys, especially the opportunity to be of service to the faculty and staff at the college. Now, once again, he is focusing on landing a position in the fire service and EMS. We believe that he possesses many of the qualities predictive of success in the role. While his level of preparation is lighter than many applicants, Mr. Day strikes us as a person who do his very best to learn the essential aspects of his job. Given to showing initiative at other places of work, he is likely to place the appropriate attention and focus on all the aspects pertaining to the job, and not only the exciting moments and calls for service. A fairly quiet and composed person by nature, he wants his actions on the job to speak for him as opposed to promoting himself to his peers and superiors in the department. Therefore, in light of our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Day be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Skokie. \"',\n",

Under no circumstances should the information or contents of this report be shared with the applicant unless under the direct supervision of a trained psychologist. We recommend that this report be considered valid for one year.

Personality does change over periods of time as a result of life experiences, successes and failures over the course of life, and major life events and traumas. In the case of public safety candidates, the exposure to tragic, traumatic, and emotionally charged events in the line of duty, coupled with the need for a quick adaptation to a paramilitary culture predicts for an increased likelihood of adjustment difficulties and possible personality changes quicker than other professions.

has worked hard to obtain the goals and objectives he has set for himself over the years Likes to stay busy and proactive; likely to make good use of his down time by addressing current needs affecting the department Expected to meet or exceed departmental performance standards on a consistent basis    : Positive relationships with most of the authority figures in his life, beginning with his parents Respectful and accommodating in his interactions with his superiors Ran into a difficult situation with his current department in which he felt his best intentions and desires to improve himself and the department were not recognized or appreciated At the same time, he has only received two minor disciplinary actions throughout his 16 years in the fire service; one for missing a meeting along with several other shift-mates while attending authorized training and the other for hitting the overhead door button while an ambulance was entering the bay that he did not see Follows the rules; will adhere to departmental policies and procedures Along this line, his frustrations with the SHFD seemed to spill over during the last promotional cycle in which he was accused of not following established protocol during a tactical exercise along with a couple of other promotional candidates; applicant denied and came across as bemused in stating his innocence    : Seasoned veteran who has had to respond to numerous critical situations and emergencies during the course of his career Focused and assertive; decisive individual who will use sound judgment under pressure Engaging and compassionate; will demonstrate a supportive bedside manner with patients May be a bit hesitant to step up and take charge with a new group of shift-mates in a new department; we believe he will pick his spots    : Open and candid in discussing some of the regrets and disappointments he has had in his life thus far Acknowledged his own contribution to problems and setbacks when they occurred Able to identify shortcomings and weaknesses and tries to improve himself Married for the past four years to an emergency room nurse;

began taking an anti-anxiety agent prescribed by his physician about a year ago which he states has helped considerably The most frustration and tension this candidate will experience will occur when his contributions are not acknowledged or even considered by his bosses Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Realistic about the prospect of once again being e2 80 9cthe new guy e2 80 9d after 16 years on the job and with several advanced fire service certifications. Realizes he will need to earn the respect and trust of his new coworkers and supervisors. We expect him to do just that through his dedication, competence, and activity level. I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Di Novo provided a typed account of his personal and professional background which contained just the basic details about his career and personal life. For example, he listed the South Holland Fire Department as his only place of employment, and he did not cite any of his certifications and other relevant qualifications which we found a bit odd given his extensive experience. In the other writing sample we administered, Mr. Di Novo demonstrated the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. A conscientious individual overall, Mr. Di Novo knows how to produce professional and informative reports and documentation as a firefighter and medic. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Di Novo to possess  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his rather remarkable educational and occupational accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. By his own admission, Mr. Di Novo did not apply himself diligently during his high school years at Eisenhower High School in Blue Island. In fact, he entered the work force immediately after graduating and did not start furthering his formal education until about eight years later. After obtaining his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in business administration from Columbia Southern University, he went on to receive his master e2 80 99s degree in communications from Lassell College in 2014, and another master e2 80 99s degree in emergency management and homeland security from Arizona State University in 2017. Coupled with his experience in the fire service and his advanced certifications, this individual has already demonstrated his ability to master the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  It is rather unusual to evaluate lateral hires in the fire service, especially after 10 years with the same department. Mr. Di Novo e2 80 99s case is a bit unusual as he explained (from his perspective) the reasons for his unhappiness with his current department due to organizational confusion, favoritism, politics, and a rather discombobulated promotional assessment for the rank of Lieutenant recently. Mr. Di Novo has very high needs for achievement and competence, and he expressed a degree of pride for extending himself in order to better his qualifications for promotion over the past several years. In our experience, it is a bit rare to find candidates with two master e2 80 99s degrees and a Fire Officer II certification testing for Lieutenant with even much larger departments than South Holland. Due to a procedural snafu during the tactical exercise, a couple of the nine candidates were given permission to use box card by the Deputy Chief and the assessors conducting the exercise. According to Mr. Di Novo, those cards were not even necessary due to the nature of the exercise, but nevertheless the process was beefed and grieved by one or two of the candidates which led to even further confusion with the command staff, Commission, and village attorneys providing mixed reviews and opinions. In the end, Mr. Di Novo and the others who used box cards were given zeros, which essentially knocked them all out of any contention or consideration for promotion. Mr. Di Novo cited other instances in which his attempts to initiate programs or implement new ideas were not even considered by some members of the command staff after being requested by them to research various problem areas. While we are not in a position to evaluate the merits of his claims about the politics and favoritism that he discussed with the SHFD, we believe he is a sincere, hardworking, and highly competent firefighter who takes his duties and responsibilities seriously. Moreover, we did not find him to be a e2 80 9cknow-it-all e2 80 9d who lords his opinions and views over others, as he came across as collaborative and team-oriented. Nevertheless, we would advise a thorough background investigation in order to get a clearer picture of this candidate e2 80 99s departure from the SHFD. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Di Novo to be an acceptable to strong applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a career firefighter. In light of our review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Di Novo be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Bolingbrook, Illinois. \"',\n",

We administered two writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On all of Mr. Duffield e2 80 99s exercises, this applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability. As implied about his pre-assessment materials, the candidate was attentive to most details. Moreover, Mr. Duffield wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, while making use of proper grammar and syntax. Even though Mr. Duffield scored below average on the spelling subsection of the Wide Range Achievement Test, we did not detect problems with his spelling in his written materials submitted as part of the assessment process. One of our written exercises was a mock report from an R.A. (Resident Assistant). Having performed this position in college, the candidate did an excellent job with the report. On the other hand, Mr. Duffield did make some assumptions in the case study that were not warranted by the information provided to the candidate. While we do not see him jumping to unwarranted conclusions, the candidate surprised us with his assessment of the situation. Regardless, there is no other evidence uncovered by our assessment which would point to this person embellishing circumstances in any kind of a misleading fashion. Overall, we believe Mr. Duffield possesses the proper thinking skills and mental ability to perform the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Duffield to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question, as he scored acceptably on all of our dimensions related to success in the role. There is a lot to like about this individual. From an early age Mr. Duffield set his mind to becoming a police officer. An outstanding baseball player, who was a member of the varsity baseball teams both in high school and college, the candidate e2 80 99s initial aptitude for the sport was nurtured early in his life by his coaches. Besides his father who coached him at a young age, most of his other youth baseball coaches were police officers. Wanting to emulate them and follow in their footsteps, Mr. Duffield enrolled in criminal justice classes at Benedictine University. In addition to majoring in criminal justice and interning for a brief time with the Kankakee Police Department, Mr. Duffield was also an R.A. in college. This kind of experience is invaluable for learning to resolve differences peaceably, using with one e2 80 99s words. Dealing with everything from noise complaints to more serious incidents, Mr. Duffield handled himself admirably. Finally, he has gained valuable practical experience working in a riverboat casino and at O e2 80 99Hare International Airport with the TSA as well as having just completed the police academy for the Chicago Police Department. Not wanting to live within the City of Chicago, he is leaving his job with the hopes of landing a law enforcement position in a suburban location. Therefore, in light of our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Duffield be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Woodridge. \"',\n",

Name: Colin Ellison Position: Firefighter Age: 23 Department: Fire Department Date: December 4, 2019     : Conscientious about the testing process, followed instructions well, and worked within the expressed timelines Punctual, arrived just short of an hour early for his scheduled appointment Clean-cut with closely cropped hair Appropriately attired, dressed in a suit and tie Comes across as energetic to the point of being excitable    : Prefers to be involved with people as opposed to working alone Tends to speak quickly and can be rather difficult to understand Eager to be a part of the firehouse, enjoys sitting around the kitchen table and talking If anything, this person has a penchant for talking too much and will probably require cautioning to be a little less social When conferring with his coworkers, this person readily expresses his views and opinions Listening skills might also prove to be a developmental need In short, his fellow firefighters will view him as rather vocal    : Rates relatively high on our measures of altruism; hence, he possesses an acceptable community service orientation An active Scout earlier in life, attained the rank of Eagle Scout; was committed to helping others from an early age On the other hand, it would be a mistake to underrate his extraordinarily high needs for excitement It is clear that this candidate is most drawn to the adrenaline rush associated with a career in the fire service and EMS In keeping with our impressions about his evolving maturity, the candidate commented that one of the aspects of the job that appeals to him is the chance e2 80 9cto break things e2 80 9d as in smashing through doors and windows at the scene of a fire    : Earned his EMT-B in 2014 on the Tech Campus of the College of Lake County Received his B.O.F. in 2015 through McHenry Community College A.A.S. degree in fire science from McHenry Community College, which was awarded in 2016 Presently pursuing his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in fire science from Southern Illinois University through classes that are being given on the campus of the College of Lake County Paramedic e2 80 99s license was awarded in 2018 through McHenry Community College Has been employed part-time with fire departments in Spring Grove, Illinois, and McHenry Township For the last three years, he has been employed by the Wauconda Fire Department, and he began his full-time employment there in June of this year Also spent four years with the Wauconda Fire Department e2 80 99s Explorers Program during high school    : From the candidate e2 80 99s rather lengthy list of training and job-related experience, it is obvious that he is committed to a career in the fire service and EMS While the applicant e2 80 99s excitable and agitated manner might annoy certain more reserved and relaxed individuals in the firehouse, there is an upside to his energetic temperament In particular, he cannot sit still for any sustained period of time, and as a result, he is the kind of firefighter who will eagerly attack chores that need doing around the fire house In addition, the candidate has been complimented by his superior officers in the fire service for his willingness to keep busy and train    : For such an excitable individual, this person reports no disciplinary actions against him at his past or present places of work in the fire service Offered only positive  about his past and present supervisors Will be responsive to any supervisor who emphasizes training and skill development Respects smart and experienced fire officers who can teach him new methods and techniques for suppressing fires and treating patients in emergency situations Wants a supervisor who will be sensitive to his needs for variety and excitement, and seek to rotate him more frequently than his fellow firefighters    : Sitting still and focusing have plagued this person throughout his life, especially in the classroom On the other hand, serving as a fire medic has forced him to focus his attention for the well-being of his patients In his own words, the candidate concentrates carefully on the emergency at hand and pushes his emotions aside It is afterwards at the fire station that he will engage in his talkative manner in processing the events from an emergency call While his talkativeness has its obvious downsides, the applicant e2 80 99s willingness to engage lonely and elderly patients in the ambulance has been cited as positive    : Due, perhaps, in part to his excitable nature, this person strikes us as a little immature On the other hand, he is just 23 years of age While it would be easy to dismiss him in many ways based on his excitable disposition, it is worth mentioning that this applicant has attained the rank of Eagle Scout during his days in scouting Furthermore, he has never been arrested He claims no previous use of illegal substances At present, he lives at home and reports no serious relationship in his life    : As implied by our previous  about the candidate, he actually possesses a stress-seeking personality Rather than be bothered by excitable situations, this individual is drawn to them Not surprisingly, his ways of relaxing involve high energy activities For example, he plays hours of videogames and also exercises as many as five times a week Also finds playing ice hockey to actually be relaxing Finally, being in the presence of other people, even away from the firehouse is relaxing for him Possesses no potentially harmful habits that would impair his performance on the job Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Caution about his tendency to talk too much and be seen as overly social with his fellow firefighters at the station Listening skills might also require some coaching I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Ellison submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate and contained a significant amount of sufficient detail and information. In addition, this person paid attention to using proper spelling and grammar. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career. The applicant, once again, demonstrated acceptable writing ability as shown by his appropriate use of grammar and syntax. In addition, the applicant provided the pertinent details to make his case for why each situation was either a highlight or a setback. Despite Mr. Ellison e2 80 99s seemingly distractible temperament, he is quite bright as measured by his solid performance on . All things considered, the candidate has the ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate exhibits appropriate emotional intelligence based on the way he discussed reassuring elderly and lonely patients while he accompanies them in the ambulance.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Ellison to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. Mr. Ellison brims with energy as evidenced by our  about this candidate. As a result, his excitable temperament has both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side of the ledger, this person likes to keep active and busy, which will mean that Mr. Ellison will be readily and eagerly invested in training during downtime at the fire station. In addition, like most active and energetic individuals, Mr. Ellison will take the initiative to do his chores and handle the many maintenance and housekeeping duties that are required around the firehouse. Moreover, even though he is excitable, during crises and emergencies, the applicant is able to narrow his focus and concentration. On the other hand, Mr. Ellison likes to talk, and his verbose manner might annoy those firefighter/paramedics who are looking for peace and quiet during downtime. In general, hyperactive people are hard to tolerate in the eyes of certain people. Nonetheless, this person has prepared himself well for a career in the fire service and EMS. In sum, the candidate is committed to his chosen profession and has proven that he can perform the job. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Ellison be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Arlington Heights. \"',\n",

Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe that the candidate demonstrates excellent emotional intelligence as evidenced by his ability to empathize with patients and their families.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Ferrici to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. There is a lot to like about this particular person as evidenced by our positive  in this report. While he probably harbored thoughts of continuing his athletic career, perhaps, as a high school coach after playing college basketball, he instead went into es. The fact that es, like organized sports, is competitive and has well-defined goals and objectives made the candidate e2 80 99s career selection seemingly a good one. Moreover, Mr. Ferrici also earned a second B.S. degree from Aquinas College in business administration. Working in es, however, did not prove to be terribly rewarding for Mr. Ferrici. It was at that time, he turned his attention toward a career in the fire service and EMS. With his second B.S. degree in exercise science, the applicant had a natural affinity for medically related issues and concerns. Last year he received his EMT-B, and since April of this year, he has been employed by a private ambulance service, Medical Express Ambulance Service. We believe that this applicant possesses the proper aptitudes and talents to be a success in the fire service and EMS. In sum, the candidate is conscientious and a team player, who has demonstrated both skills previously during his life. Therefore, in light of our overall, favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Ferrici be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Matteson. \"',\n",

We also administered to Mr. Finnander a written exercise citing both a highlight and setback thus far in his life. This exercise as well was completed in a detailed manner. Mr. Finnander expresses himself very well in writing, and as a result, he should not encounter any trouble preparing documentation directed at seeking reimbursement for medical services and expenses. The above-reported test results by Mr. Finnander on  are rather reassuring. We predict, for example, that this person will grasp new information and material quickly. Beyond his measured mental ability, we observed this applicant to be empathetic towards those in need of help and assistance. Mr. Finnander is able to read social cues, as he is able to gain favor with his peers and often rises to positions of leadership among the members of this group. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Finnander to possess the proper thinking skills as they pertain to learning and mastering of the essential elements of the job on question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Finnander to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. There is clearly a lot to like about this candidate who registered either strong or acceptable ratings on all of the dimensions related to success in the fire service and EMS. Half-jokingly, the candidate claims that when he was in the first grade, he rode on a fire truck with the Des Plaines Fire Department. While he remembers the experience fondly, it was through an uncle who was a member of the Lake Forest Fire Department that he learned about the job and decided to pursue a similar line of work. Even before the candidate competed college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he managed to earn his EMT-B. Throughout his life Mr. Finnander has been a standout athlete, who was the captain of both the varsity football team and the varsity basketball team at Maine West High School in Des Plaines, where he was raised. The experience taught the applicant to appreciate the value of teamwork, Mr. Finnander and finds the fire service and EMS as providing ample opportunity to work alongside others. We have made mention several times in our report that Mr. Finnander is a leader, and as a result, we anticipate this candidate will eventually rise to occasion and ascend in rank in his fire service career. All things considered this applicant will be an asset to whichever community hires him. Therefore, in light of our highly favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Finnander be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Skokie. \"',\n",

Mr. Fiordaliso also used proper spelling and grammar on his Personal History Form. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career. The applicant outlined his response by the numbers, but in Mr. Fiordaliso e2 80 99s defense, he demonstrated acceptable writing ability with the appropriate grammar and syntax. On the other hand, he could have done a better job of providing pertinent details. The scores registered by Mr. Fiordaliso on  are reassuring.

According to the candidate, he was exposed to the closeness of the firehouse along with all of the equipment, which any youngster would find interesting and exciting. After graduating from Buffalo Grove High School in 2010, Mr. Fiordaliso held a number of entry level jobs from restaurant server to laborer. At the same time, the applicant was attending community college to pursue his fire science degree. Mr. Fiordaliso also earned the necessary credentials to work as a firefighter/paramedic. Not only does this person possess the proper training and credentials to perform the job, but he gained valuable practical experience as a firefighter/paramedic with two well-regarded Chicago area fire departments. Experienced in handling emergencies and trauma as well as committed to training in order to improve his firefighting and EMS skills, we see him as an asset to any department. If he has a shortcoming of sorts, this individual knows a lot about the fire service and EMS, and he will not be shy about sharing that information with his fellow firefighter/paramedics. This has not always been appreciated as it can cause the candidate to come across as a know-it-all. Nevertheless, in light of our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Fiordaliso be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Bartlett Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

Should not encounter difficulty at the academy. However, when the rubber hits the road during his field training and probationary period, we anticipate that Mr. Florine will adapt appropriately to the routine stresses and challenges of the job. Mild-mannered and confident, but will need to ramp up a sense of authoritative presence in certain situations. We believe this will evolve over time with the proper training. I    Average  (assesses cognitive abilities)    Spelling          s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Florine provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional life which included essential details and a degree of elaboration at times. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated  writing ability, as he consistently expressed himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. This literate and fairly bright applicant has the ability to produce professional and informative reports and documentation as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Florine to possess  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his educational and occupational accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above. Graduating with honors from Notre Dame High School in 2013, Mr. Florine spent most of his time away from his studies working part-time. Originally, this applicant wanted to become an athletic trainer, and spent one semester at the University of Iowa, but found the subject matter and curriculum not quite what he expected it to be. As a result, he returned home and decided on a business career and went on to obtain his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in finance from Illinois State in 2017. Throughout his college career, Mr. Florine e2 80 99s grades were . All things considered, this applicant has the capacity to master the essential information and skills required to become a police officer.  The elder of two children, Mr. Florine grew up on Chicago e2 80 99s north side as his father was employed as a Chicago Firefighter throughout his developmental years. In addition, this applicant reportedly has several other family members employed as police officers, stating that he grew up hearing their stories about the rewards and gratification of community service work. Although he thought about a career in business, this active and energetic candidate simply realized that he it was hard for him to be confined to a desk and computer monitor all day, and that the desire to serve a greater purpose other than making money was more important to him. He has been applying for selected police officer positions for the past year, and reportedly just received word that he is being sent forward by CPD for his psychological assessment. Overall, Mr. Florine came across as enthusiastic, motivated, and confident that he is making the right choice in his career direction, and we believe he will put forth his best efforts during his training and education as a police officer. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Florine to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question, as he received favorable ratings on all but one of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. Despite his lack of relevant experience and formal education in criminal justice studies, Mr. Florine is a stable, grounded, and level-headed applicant who seems to possess a realistic perception of what life may be like for him as a police officer. From our perspective, this individual has a number of positive attributes predictive of success in police work, as we anticipate that he will grow and develop along with the job. He is bright, motivated, positive, conscientious, and should prove to be a pleasure to coach and supervise. With that being said, we would recommend that Mr. Florine be extended an offer of employment to serve as a Police Officer with the Hoffman Estates Police Department. \"',\n",

It took Mr. Frausto three tries to pass the tests required for his EMT-B certification, and we got the sense that the demand for continuous testing in the fire service and emergency medicine might have been a factor steering him toward law enforcement. His motivation for making the change strikes us as genuine, as it is based on his focus to improve communities and help their members. Both fire service and law enforcement careers can be fast-paced and keep people on the move. Mr. Frausto does not want to sit behind a desk all day long. Gifted with both a solid work ethic and the kind of disposition that will show respect for his fellow officers and the public-at-large, we think that he will be an asset to the department over time. Therefore, in light of our overall positive review, we would recommend that Mr. Frausto be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Chicago Heights. \"',\n",

Appropriately attired in a gray suit along with a red dress shirt and tie Worked hard to manage his impression in a favorable light as possible However, once the candidate was cautioned about his behavior, he ceased trying to embellish his suitability for the job    : During his interview at our offices, the candidate came across as a bit of a wiseacre We sense that he likes being at the center of attention His attempts at humor also allow the applicant to alleviate his anxieties, especially when he is feeling uncomfortable as he was in the assessment process He should generally be courteous and respectful of his fellow firefighter/paramedics At the same time, he will not hold back his  if he feels as though one of his partners is acting rudely towards patients    : Sees the fire service and emergency medicine as an honorable profession It will allow the applicant an opportunity to give back to the community While we suspect that some of his answers were designed to tell us what he thought we wanted to hear, he does have a history for helping others and volunteering his time Much of his volunteering was done at the library where his mother is currently employed There is also a part of the job that gives the candidate a feeling of status as he is able to learn and grow while acquiring the proper credentials to become a full-fledged firefighter/paramedic The action and excitement of the job has tremendous appeal for the applicant    : Has his A.A.S. degree from Harper College, which he earned in fire science technology in 2012 Was also awarded his EMT-B through

his paramedic e2 80 99s license Has his B.O.F. through the Elk Grove Township Fire Department Has spent the last four years with Superior Ambulance since July of 2012    : The candidate is to be commended for his four-year tenure with his current company, Superior Ambulance The candidate has had a relatively clean work history although he was asked to resign from his job at Jewel during high school for trying to use a discount coupon he found lying on the ground of the store e2 80 99s parking lot His only other job action against him was for appearing unshaven at Superior Ambulance earlier this year To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he took responsibility for his actions Will been seen as hardworking and willing to learn new things    : Has a healthy respect for those serving in positions of authority, although his relationship with his own father was problematic Will respond well to an approachable and patient supervisor who is willing to take the time to help him learn his job better Responds well to a knowledgeable supervisor who practices leadership-by-example His superiors have been generally complimentary of the candidate e2 80 99s performance They have, however, cautioned him to slow down as he can allow himself to become overwhelmed when he has a lot of things to remember at once    : His excitableness has not spilled over to the candidate e2 80 99s approach to handling emergencies and trauma He has been able to detach himself emotionally from such scenes, even though initially the applicant admitted to being shocked by certain sights and smells For example, he has witnessed serious trauma, to include unspeakable injuries and assaults on children On those occasions where a call has been particularly disturbing, this person will process the event with his partner in the ambulance    : The applicant held himself fully accountable for the incidents cited previously in this report We do not see him as prone to making excuses for his behavior, although he did initially begin his interview with the psychologist trying hard to manage his impression in as favorable a light as possible In the past this person has acted responsibly for the most part with no prior arrests and his usage of illegal substances confined to smoking marijuana only two or three times Worked two jobs during his time at community college in order to fund his education    : Appears committed to EMS as a career, he has been with his current company for the past four years We do not envision him leaving the position in question if it is offered to him The applicant witnessed alcoholism in his family of origin and hence, he is wary of its implications His consumption of alcohol is moderate, but the applicant did admit that he drinks on a weekly basis His primary outlets for stress involve outdoor activities along with spending time with family and friends, who serve as a sufficient support network for him Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Monitoring of his behavior on the job to watch for those situations where he tends to allow himself to become overwhelmed. In those instances where his excitability seems to get the best of him, we would recommend coaching and guidance from his superior officers in the department.

His written materials were also quite complete. These qualities e2 80 93 neatness and paying attention to the details e2 80 93 are critical for handling the paperwork piece of the position in question. In particular, these qualities will pertain to paperwork centering on preparing EMS reports, which can become matters of public record. The above-reported test scores are encouraging as Mr. Fuhs scored either average or higher on both the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Apprai Test and . These average to  scores predict for learning the essential elements of a new job as quickly as the average new hire. Overall, we see Mr. Fuhs as a selective learner in that he does better in classes related to his chosen line of work because he is interested and invested in improving his skills in order to better serve the public at large.  Mr. Fuhs spent the first ten years of his life in the Norwood Park community on the northwest side of Chicago. After that his family relocated to northwest suburban Hoffman Estates, where Mr. Fuhs spent the remainder of his youth. His father is an electrician and his mother is a librarian, and it was at his mother e2 80 99s place of work where the candidate claims that he performed volunteer activities. As a youngster, we suspect that his childhood was marred by his father erratic and occasionally abusive behavior. According to the candidate, for example, his father would discipline Mr. Fuhs and his three siblings by making them do as many as 100 push-ups for each offense. As noted in  of this report, the applicant e2 80 99s father was afflicted by alcoholism, which became worse while Mr. Fuhs was in high school. On several occasions, the candidate had to intervene to protect his younger siblings from his father e2 80 99s wrath. We mention this background information only because it has probably contributed to the candidate e2 80 99s excitable disposition. We believe that while this situation has left its scars -- as it would for anyone -- the applicant has been able to overcome these childhood incidents and present himself as a functioning adult. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Fuhs to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. According to the candidate, he first became interested in the fire service as a youngster, which is typical of many applicants for these kinds of public safety jobs. To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he pursued his interests after graduating from high school by enrolling at a local community college. He not only earned the proper credentials for EMS, to include his EMT-B and recently successfully finishing his course work for his paramedic e2 80 99s license, but he also was awarded his A.A.S. degree in fire science technology from Harper College in Palatine, Illinois. In addition, he has his B.O.F. certification. This person has been an EMT with a private ambulance company for the past four years. We see this individual as open to feedback and coaching as he is eager to improve his skills in his line of work. We also believe that he will behave responsibly with the right kind of patient leadership and supervision guiding his efforts. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Fuhs be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Hanover Park. \"',\n",

We believe Mr. Fuhs will handle the paperwork piece of the position in question, when preparing EMS reports, which can become matters of public record. The above-reported test scores also show that Mr. Fuhs does quite well in educational settings, and should be able to learn the essential elements of a new job as quickly as the average new hire. With all of this said, we see Mr. Fuhs as a selective learner in that he does better in classes related to his chosen line of work because he is interested and invested in improving his skills to better serve the public at large. His reported grades throughout high school and college were , and we do not anticipate that he will have difficulty when called upon to apply his education and training to duties related to the fire service.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Fuhs to be a less than acceptable applicant for the position in question. Mr. Fuhs has struggled to land a position in the fire service and EMS outside of his current role with the Barrington Countryside Fire Protection District. According to the candidate, he lists testing at no less than 16 different fire departments and fire protection districts. Between failing polygraph tests and not being able to the pass psychological examination, Mr. Fuhs is frustrated. Given what we observed with Mr. Fuhs trying to manage his impression is as favorable a light as possible, we sense that he has not been completely truthful when taking the polygraph tests and psychological examinations. As our report indicates, we observed problems with his conscientiousness along with his ability to act in a mature fashion. In the close confines of the fire station, Mr. Fuhs e2 80 99 behavior is unlikely to be appreciated by his peers and supervisors. We also believe that his careless attitude, marked by his selective motivation will reflect badly on his work habits. Finally, Mr. Fuhs is prone to making excuses for himself as a way to rationalize his mistakes. This habit will wear thin on his superiors. Therefore, in light of our many stated concerns and reservations, we would not be comfortable in recommending that Mr. Fuhs be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Mount Prospect. \"',\n",

We believe her thoroughness and detail-orientation is emblematic of how she operates when given any assignment, which may detract from her efficiency at times. Nevertheless, Ms. Gaeding demonstrated the ability to consistently express herself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Although she may need to be more concise and succinct at times, we expect professional and informative reports and documentation from this candidate on a consistent basis. Overall, we evaluate Ms. Gaeding to possess  mental ability despite her sub-par score on our standardized test of critical thinking cited above. This assertion is supported by her occupational and educational accomplishments to date, and by the manner in which she was able to express her thoughts and ideas (orally and on paper) during her assessment. Throughout her high school and college years, Ms. Gaeding has distinguished herself as a scholar and an athlete, which correlates with her drive and desire to pursue a fire service career, as she looks forward to the mental and physical aspects of the job. We are at a loss to explain her below average score on the Watson-Glaser, as this individual is fully capable of making logical and rational decisions, and we found her problem-solving ability to be  based upon her accounts of her actions in several job-related scenarios. A motivated and determined young woman, Ms. Gaeding has the capacity to master the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  An outstanding student at Fremd High School, Ms. Gaeding also distinguished herself as an athlete while never missing a day of school. This candidate e2 80 99s high needs for achievement and overall level of energy have propelled her throughout her life, as she went on to obtain her bachelor e2 80 99s degree in kinesiology from the University of Illinois where she also graduated with distinction, and was involved in several extracurricular activities at the university including club lacrosse. Although she has enjoyed her time as an athletic trainer and rehabilitation technician over the past four years, Ms. Gaeding stated that she found e2 80 9csomething missing e2 80 9d with respect to satisfaction and meaning in her career. Recalling her early interest in the fire service after her father e2 80 99s heart attack while she was in high school, Ms. Gaeding has focused on bettering her qualifications and skills to transition into a fire service career. There are not many pretenses about this individual, and we believe she will be a hardworking and likable addition to the department. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Gaeding to be an  if not strong candidate for the position in question, as she received favorable ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. Overall, we liked the balance she brings to the position in terms of her amiable and collaborative interpersonal style and strong task orientation. It should be noted that Ms. Gaeding ranks relatively high on a couple of suburban fire department hiring lists. Once she has completed her academy training and probationary period, we do not believe it will take her very long to land a career position in the fire service. In light of our favorable review, we would recommend that Ms. Gaeding be given an offer to work as a Part-Time Firefighter for the Countryside Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

A bright, motivated, and determined young woman, Ms. Gaeding has the capacity to master the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  An outstanding student at Fremd High School, Ms. Gaeding also distinguished herself as an athlete while never missing a day of school. This candidate e2 80 99s high needs for achievement and overall level of energy have propelled her throughout her life, as she went on to obtain her bachelor e2 80 99s degree in kinesiology from the University of Illinois, graduating with distinction. Ms. Gaeding was also involved in several extracurricular activities at the university including club lacrosse. Although she enjoyed her time as an athletic trainer and rehabilitation technician for about four years, Ms. Gaeding stated that she found e2 80 9csomething missing e2 80 9d with respect to satisfaction and e2 80 9cmeaning e2 80 9d in her career. Recalling her early interest in the fire service after her father e2 80 99s heart attack while she was in high school, Ms. Gaeding has focused on bettering her qualifications and skills to transition into a fire service career. There are not many pretenses about this individual, and we believe she will be a hardworking and likable addition to the department. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Gaeding to be a strong candidate for the position in question, as she received favorable ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. Overall, we like the balance she brings to the position in terms of her amiable and collaborative interpersonal style, and her strong task orientation. Although she has been delighted with her experience over the past six months as a probationary firefighter with Palatine-Rural, she is seeking a larger and more diverse department with a higher call volume and more opportunities for specialization, training, and advancement. This applicant manages her time effectively and in a disciplined manner. It should be noted that Ms. Gaeding ranks relatively high on a couple of suburban fire department hiring lists, and she added that she is currently being processed by another nearby department with a similar call volume. In light of our highly favorable review, we would recommend that Ms. Gaeding be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Hoffman Estates Fire Department. \"',\n",

For example, the candidate was generally attentive to most of the important details. Moreover, Ms. Garcia wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences.

Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Garcia to be a less than acceptable applicant for the position in question. While there is a lot we like about this well-intended young woman, who possesses an unusually sweet disposition, we believe that she will struggle to succeed in the role of a sworn police officer when having to engage in potentially dangerous and potentially life-threatening situations. In keeping with our perception of this person, she initially thought about nursing and studied the field while in college at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois. However, during her junior year, she switched majors to forensics, and the applicant was later awarded her B.A. degree in that field from Lewis University in 2016. After a ride-along with a local police agency, the candidate was convinced that law enforcement was the career for her. As noted above, Ms. Garcia possesses a winning, warm and accommodating personality. Able to easily engage people, Ms. Garcia e2 80 99s  are one of her major strengths. On the other hand, this individual has not had much practical exposure to law enforcement. Instead, she has spent much of her working life to date as a nanny. Disciplining young children is a far cry from working on the street. If Ms. Garcia is truly committed to a career in law enforcement, she would do well to apply for an auxiliary position, such as a community service officer, in order to get a better of idea of what she is committing to doing a career.

though he reportedly tried marijuana at the age of 15 Has been in two long-term relationships, but is currently single Overall, expected to hold himself accountable for his actions on and off the job    : Stable and relatively well-adjusted, but may take some of the job-related stress home with him more than he would care to admit Supportive base of family and trusted friends As an extroverted individual, he will tend to find the most reassurance and support by talking things out with fellow firefighters after troubling calls for service Keeps himself in good physical condition; enjoys several social and recreational outlets which help him to relax and blow off steam when necessary Enjoys working with his hands, fixing cars, and being outdoors to relax; he takes pride in being handy Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Comes across with an air of arrogance but seems to care deeply about providing quality care to members of the community. He might benefit from guidance related to the  he makes on others, especially in dealing with citizens. This bright candidate will be open to feedback and learning how to improve; he will want to meet and exceed the expectations of his superiors. He seems to us to be a good-hearted guy who can come off as brash at times. I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Gloodt provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that included basic details, but not much more. He was more elaborative during his interview than he was on paper. Nevertheless, this individual is fully capable of expressing himself in complete and coherent sentences that contain proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Mr. Gloodt is expected to produce professional reports. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Gloodt to possess  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his grades throughout high school and college, and by his occupational accomplishments to date. Mr. Gloodt graduated from Marist High School in Chicago, Illinois, in 2006 with a reported 3.8/4.0 GPA average. Mr. Gloodt wanted to further his formal education related to his chosen career goals, so he earned two associate e2 80 99s degrees from Moraine Valley Community College in both fire science and emergency medical service. Mr. Gloodt has applied himself diligently to better his skills and qualifications for a career position in the fire service. All things considered, this individual can master the essential information and skills required of a firefighter and paramedic.  Mr. Gloodt is the younger of two children, and he was raised primarily by his mother in Willow Springs, Illinois. According to Mr. Gloodt, his parents divorced when he was in the second grade, which was admittedly a tough time for him. However, Mr. Gloodt maintained that his father remains an involved part of his life. Mr. Gloodt talked about his unwavering commitment to a career in the fire service that started since he graduated from high school. He has worked hard to better his skills and qualifications for a career position in the fire service. He claims that his first choice of a department is Bloomingdale Fire Protection District given its reputation among other firefighters he knows. Although he reported that Bloomingdale was his first choice of a destination department, he apparently passed on his first offer to work there for reasons that are unknown. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Gloodt to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on many of the key dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. While his intensity and assertive nature might take some getting used to, Mr. Gloodt will be appreciated for his energy, intelligence, commitment, and loyalty to his coworkers. He may come across as a bit outspoken; however, our assessment indicates that he is open-minded and coachable. We do not envision this candidate overstepping his bounds with his supervisors, and he will frame his many questions in a respectful manner to learn from his superiors. With further training and experience, we believe Mr. Gloodt should prove himself to be a competent and capable career firefighter and medic. In summation, we would recommend that Mr. Gloodt be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Bloomingdale Fire Protection District. ERL/\"',\n",

Because the report may contain certain developmental recommendations or special cautions concerning an applicant, we advise that only those managers involved in the supervision of the individual have access to the report.

Under no circumstances should the information or contents of this report be shared with the applicant unless under the direct supervision of a trained psychologist. We recommend that this report be considered valid for one year.

Personality does change over periods of time as a result of life experiences, successes and failures over the course of life, and major life events and traumas. In the case of public safety candidates, the exposure to tragic, traumatic, and emotionally charged events in the line of duty, coupled with the need for a quick adaptation to a paramilitary culture predicts for an increased likelihood of adjustment difficulties and possible personality changes quicker than other professions. Moreover, because of the unique combination of skills required for each position, this report pertains to the job in question, only. Therefore, this report is not intended to be used for decisions about future promotions.  Name: Eugene Godek Position: Firefighter Age: 32 Department: Fire Department Date: January 6, 2020   y  : Pleasant and polite; appropriately respectful of others, especially those in superior positions to him Will defer to those in positions of authority Very quiet and reserved by nature Communicates in an acceptable fashion Demonstrated acceptable listening skills Has a background in competitive sports, and we view him as a collaborative and loyal team player Expected to forge comfortable and genuine relationships with his peers On the other hand, we sense that the candidate could be more confident in his abilities In short, he strikes us as self-conscious  AND PERSONA   : States that he possesses a e2 80 9cpassion e2 80 9d for his work Scored  on our measures of altruism even though he is striving for self-satisfaction in his work Also drawn to the variety, activity, and mental and physical challenges involved in the fire service For example, he scored high on our measures of excitement-seeking Should be viewed as a mature and approachable public servant by citizens on      : Possesses the appropriate certifications and licenses required to perform the position in question In particular, he has earned his EMT-B, paramedic e2 80 99s license, and B.O.F. certification Came across as open and honest in discussing some of the regrets and disappointments that he has had in his life thus far For example, ten years ago, he received a DUI which dramatically altered his outlook on life as he no longer consumes alcohol Expected to honor his commitments and obligations We believe he fully understands that being a public servant requires him to be alert, attentive, and focused without the residual effects of any type of substance (legal or illegal)     : Rates  on our measures of conscientiousness, which was not entirely reflected in the materials he submitted as part of his assessment Competitive person who will strive to meet or exceed departmental performance standards in most areas Active, energetic, and a dedicated individual with a strong work ethic Presently works a couple of different jobs, occasionally totaling as many as 80 hours a week Rates high on our measures of achievement  Serious about his duties and essential job functions Reliable, dependable, and consistent in his basic work habits Strong track record for attendance and punctuality Has had positive relationships with most of the authority figures in his life Applicant has followed the rules throughout most of his life; will adhere to departmental policies and procedures  ability to cope with stress, remain composed, be assertive  : During his four years with the Montgomery and Countryside Fire Protection District, this person has witnessed a wide variety of emergencies and trauma Sensitive to the stress placed on families as they watch a loved one suffer As such, we have few concerns about this individual e2 80 99s bedside manner in dealing with patients in terms of empathy, compassion, and the ability to convey reassurance Keeps himself in very good physical condition, and he enjoys various sports and recreational activities Small but supportive base of family and a couple of close friends With all of this said, we observed this person to be prone to worry; may need some encouragement to find methods for appropriately processing his emotions Possesses no potentially harmful habits that would impair his performance on the job As mentioned previously, the applicant abstains from the use of alcohol  An approachable and understanding supervisor who will help the applicant adjust to his new surroundings I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Godek submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate, but it could have contained a higher degree of detail and information. In addition, Mr. Godek did not always adhere to the proper rules of spelling and grammar on his Personal History Form. We also administered one other writing sample which was a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the applicant e2 80 99s career in the fire service and EMS. On this exercise, this applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability by using appropriate grammar and syntax. Moreover, Mr. Godek did a much better job of providing the pertinent details. A review of Mr. Godek e2 80 99s scores on the above-reported  are reassuring. All things considered, the candidate has the ability to learn the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate demonstrates solid emotional intelligence as evidenced by his ability to show empathy at the scene of a tragedy.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Godek to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. The candidate claims that he first took an interest in the fire service and EMS about six or seven years ago. However, Mr. Godek was faced with family obligations, which meant sticking with his job for a landscaping company. To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he has been steadily employed with that company since the spring of 2006. Beginning in 2016, Mr. Godek began pursuing his dreams of becoming a firefighter/paramedic. Steadily applying himself, the applicant earned the necessary credentials to become a fire medic as stated in  of this report. There is no question that that this candidate is a hard worker. Between his 24 to 48 hours a week at the Montgomery and Countryside Fire Protection District, the candidate continues to work with his long-time employer Bic Yardworks. Mr. Godek also recently purchased a truck so that he can earn additional income for his family by plowing snow in the winter months. All told, this individual often logs as many as 80 hours a week. While he seemed a little tentative and anxious about the assessment process, this was his first time through any kind of psychological examination. Overall, there is a lot to admire about the applicant. Mr. Godek is a mature, honest, and empathetic applicant with a strong work ethic. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Godek be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the City of Elmhurst. \"',\n",

Name: Daniel Golaszewski Position: Police Officer Age: 23 Department: Police Department Date: January 6, 2020   y  : Respectful and cooperative Communicates clearly when speaking and listens well Open and honest in his dealings with other people without coming across as either rude or abrupt Rates high on our measures of agreeableness; should be able to forge comfortable working relationships with his fellow officers Looks forward to the camaraderie connected with a career in law enforcement Cheerful and optimistic; others will appreciate his positive attitude as part of the team On the other hand, the applicant admits that his initial impression is one of a quiet and reserved individual, which dissipates when this person gets to know people better  AND PERSONA   : Scored  on our measures of altruism Seemed genuine and sincere in his desire to serve, protect, and assist others in need Also drawn to the variety, activity, and mental and physical challenges involved in a law enforcement career Fairly extensive customer service background in his employment at AT&T; will be polite and courteous in his interactions with citizens Should be viewed as an approachable and credible officer despite his somewhat youthful appearance     : College degree is in cyber security, which required the candidate to enroll in no less than seven courses in criminal justice Had supervisory experience at AT&T and other places of employment Came across as open and honest in discussing some of the regrets and disappointments he has had in his life thus far Expected to honor his commitments and obligations No brushes with law enforcement Reports never having used any kind of illegal substances Fiscally responsible to date     : Active, energetic, and dedicated individual with a strong work ethic Rates high on our measures of achievement  Reliable, dependable, and consistent in his basic work habits Followed the rules throughout his life; expected to do the same with guidelines and policies Compliant and dutiful individual who will adhere to standard operating guidelines Strong track record for attendance and punctuality Has had positive relationships with most of the authority figures in his life Looking for an honest and approachable supervisor offering direct feedback to help him learn and grow  ability to cope with stress, remain composed, be assertive  : Able to enforce rules and regulations in a diplomatic and courteous fashion On the other hand, he is untested in the area of enforcement of rules despite supervising at AT&T; states that discipline was handled by the store manager Regardless, he might be a stickler for the rules; will require some guidance on how to be more flexible Keeps himself in very good physical condition, and he enjoys various sports and recreational activities to promote relaxation Small, but supportive base of family and a couple of close friends Lives at home, but has been involved in a steady and committed relationship this past year Not prone toward prolonged periods of worry or depression Possesses no potentially harmful habits that would impair his performance on the job or derail his goals and objectives For example, the candidate consumes alcohol in moderation  Coaching and advice on how to handle routine enforcement situations to avoid being seen as rigid and by-the-book Open and honest feedback on his job performance A serious discussion about his plans for a career in law enforcement as he is likely to seek to use his cyber security degree in a federal role Exploring ways to take advantage of the candidate e2 80 99s computer capabilities to the advantage of the department I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Golaszewski submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate and contained sufficient detail and information. In addition, Mr. Golaszewski used proper spelling and grammar on his Personal History Form. We also administered two other writing samples, which included a mock police report as well as a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career in law enforcement. On both of these exercises, this applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability. This person sought to present his highlight and setback in a succinct, outline form, but in his favor, Mr. Golaszewski employed the appropriate grammar and syntax while providing the pertinent details. The score recorded on the  section of  is lower than desired, but regardless, we do not have any reason to believe that Mr. Golaszewski will struggle with the paperwork and report writing piece of the position in question. All things considered, the candidate clearly possesses the ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Golaszewski to be an acceptable candidate for the position in question. Unlike many public safety applicants, especially those looking for a career in law enforcement, Mr. Golaszewski e2 80 99s route to the job has not be very traditional. According to the candidate, his only connection with law enforcement is through several relatives who are police officers in Poland, where his parents resided before immigrating to the United States prior to the birth of Mr. Golaszewski and his younger brother. In college, the candidate pursued a degree in cyber security, and he graduated from Loyola University with his B.S. degree in the field in 2018. With the ongoing War on Terrorism, cyber security will be a key focal point for the United States and other sovereign nations. As a result, we wonder how long Mr. Golaszewski will remain with the Schaumburg Police Department should he receive an offer from a federal agency involved in cyber security operations. As a result, it is worth having a frank discussion with Mr. Golaszewski about his career intentions in light of his formal education. Perhaps, even more important for the department, it would be worth the agency e2 80 99s time to explore ways to take advantage of the candidate e2 80 99s computer savvy and skills for its own use. Regardless, in light of our overall, favorable review of this individual, we would recommend that Mr. Golaszewski be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Schaumburg. \"',\n",

Name: Elia Gonzalez Position: Police Officer Age: 31 Department: Police Department Date: May 31, 2019     : Late by 15 minutes for her appointment at our office; attributed delays to her medical examination which was scheduled for the same day This situation caused the candidate to be flustered initially, but to her credit, she settled down and seemed more relaxed for the remainder of her assessment Casually attired, but neatly groomed for her appointment Energetic and expressive communicator, who is easy to engage in conversation Overall, she is likely to be perceived as more approachable than authoritative    : Although there is a dramatic side to this person e2 80 99s disposition, we do not see her as engaging in gossip and rumors with her fellow officers She has been described by past and present colleagues as upbeat and friendly Speaks with energy and enthusiasm; hence people will enjoy being in her company Outgoing and gregarious nature speak to being more of an extravert than an introvert Possesses a strong preference for being part of a team as opposed to working in isolation from her peers    : Various personal issues have sidetracked this individual from pursuing a career in public service, to include enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps after graduating from high school This person wants to make a positive impact in her community She has not engaged in any volunteer work in her community, stating that she has a lot going on in her life filling up her schedule Besides wanting to make a difference, this individual is drawn to fast-paced and exciting environments after having spent many years working in a public library  relevant work and life experience  : No formal education or training in law enforcement Has not performed any kind of work pertaining to law enforcement, such as private security or loss prevention She has had limited contact with the Calumet City Police Department, who have been called on occasion to handle disruptive patrons at the Calumet City Public Library According to the candidate, the Calumet City Public Library was situated in a e2 80 9crough neighborhood, e2 80 9d but we do not see this as something which would have particularly prepared her well for becoming a sworn police officer    : Terminated by the Calumet City Public Library for her frequent tardiness Although the applicant only worked four days a week at the library, she admitted to being late two or three days a week on average When coworkers began to complain that allowing the applicant to be late while they were required to be on time, her supervisors took action and terminated this individual As noted above, the applicant was late for her appointment at our office, and even she acknowledges that she could e2 80 9cmost definitely improve e2 80 9d her time-management skills Despite the observation that this individual tried hard to make herself look like an outstanding candidate on paper with her distortion of our measures of conscientiousness, we see her as lacking the self-discipline to perform the position in question    : Has not worked in any kind of a military or paramilitary type of setting even though she harbored ideas of wanting to join the Marines right after graduating high school Problems with tardiness will not sit well with her superiors who will expect her to be on time for her shift Has had prior brushes with the law, with her most serious offense involving battery against a woman the applicant accused of having an affair with her father We believe the rules and regulations required to serve as a sworn police officer will cause the candidate to struggle to adjust to her new surroundings  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : This individual strikes us as excitable, which will not serve her well in dealing with dangerous encounters on the street Admits that there have been several occasions at different places of work where she has felt stress, which has a tendency to easily overwhelm her Having to multi-task on the job will cause this person stress and frustration Has been involved in incidents of domestic battery at the hands of the father of her two youngest children    : Working hard to raise her three children as a single mother Overall, has managed her finances reasonably well; currently renting her home, has $10,000 remaining on her car loan, and credit card debt of $3,000 Nevertheless, based on her distortion of our personality tests, we think that this person is sensitive about her shortcomings In light of this observation, she is likely to become defensive in the face of constructive criticism as she did when she was cautioned about improperly managing her impression on our standardized measures of personality skills    : Acknowledges that when upset she tends to personalize, especially when engaged in arguments or disputes with other people The pressure and stress of serving as a sworn police officer are likely to overwhelm this individual While she is drawn to fast-paced situations, they do not necessarily serve her personality well as they tend to make her even more excitable Much of her life at the present time is devoted to the care of her three children, ages 11, eight and nine; she has been their sole source of financial and emotional support For the past three months the candidate has been dating a Calumet City police officer, who has been a source of some support for her  This person would be best served by first looking for work in an auxiliary position, such as a CSO or in security if she is serious about becoming a sworn police officer We do not see her as prepared or ready for the job of a municipal police officer I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Ms. Gonzalez completed her Personal History Form in a complete and comprehensible manner. She provided accurate and sufficiently detailed information that was easy to follow. We also administered two other writing samples (both of which were typed). On each of these exercises, this applicant demonstrated excellent writing ability. In particular, this person was attentive to most of the important details. Furthermore, Ms. Gonzalez wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, while making use of proper grammar and syntax. These observations lead us to believe that the candidate could capably handle the paperwork and report writing demands of the position in question. The fact that Ms. Gonzalez performed well on both sections of  also bodes well for her ability to learn quickly. Ms. Gonzalez strikes us as having good intellect and fairly good common sense, although some of her personality traits will impede her effectiveness on the street at this time. Having no training or experience in law enforcement related roles, this makes us very cautious about the candidate e2 80 99s suitability for the job of a sworn police officer.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Gonzalez to be an unacceptable applicant for the position in question at this point. We do not see that appointing her to a sworn position would be doing her or the community much good at the present time. Ms. Gonzalez is not properly prepared for the role of a police officer. Possessing an excitable temperament, this will not serve her well on the street without the proper training and experience in comparable situations. We suspect that multi-tasking is a challenge for her, and if this is the case, she will struggle during her probationary period to handle the multiple duties and responsibilities entailed in the job. If she were e2 80 9cwashed out, e2 80 9d so to speak, during her probationary period, neither Ms. Gonzalez nor the Matteson Police Department would gain from the failed experience. We believe that it would be in Ms. Gonzalez e2 80 99s best interest to start at a lower level in a police agency. For example, she might try serving in an auxiliary role, such as that of a community service officer. This would allow her to learn about the ins-and-outs of a municipal police department. This would also provide her exposure to the rules and regulations of a paramilitary organization. Ms. Gonzalez would be forced to overcome her perennial problems of lateness and time management if she expected to remain in her job. In addition, the applicant would have the opportunity to interact with the public, and have a chance to enforce laws and ordinances such as those associated with parking violations. However, in light of our cautious review at this time of this candidate, we would are not in favor of recommending that Ms. Gonzalez be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Matteson. \"',\n",

Can be a perfectionist at times. Very organized, well-prepared, and methodical. May need to demonstrate flexibility  in new and novel situations. This candidate should be a pleasure to supervise and has the potential to demonstrate leadership abilities over time on the job. I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Gonzalez provided a neatly typed and reasonably detailed account of his personal and professional background. In so doing, this applicant provided all relevant information and a degree of elaboration whenever it was necessary. Overall, Mr. Gonzalez demonstrated average writing ability, as he was able to express himself in complete sentences most of the time. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Gonzalez to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his academic and occupational accomplishments to date, his test scores, and by the way he was able to express his thoughts and ideas during his assessment. Stating that he grew up speaking Spanish, Mr. Gonzalez remains fluent in that language. Mr. Gonzalez provided several scenarios and situations in which he demonstrated sound judgment and rational decision-making, which we believe he will employ in a position as a police officer. All things considered, this motivated and determined individual will make it a point to master the essential information and skills required to become a police officer.  The oldest of three children, Mr. Gonzalez spent most of his youth in northwest suburban Carpentersville, Illinois, where he continues to reside with his parents and younger twin siblings. Mr. Gonzalez e2 80 99s parents encouraged him to pursue a career from an early age. He heeded their advice, but there was no money available for him to attend college, which sparked his interest in the military. According to Mr. Gonzalez, it was his Army recruiter who steered him toward police work and law enforcement as a career choice and assisted him in selecting one of the better law enforcement curriculums in the country at Western Illinois University. Considering himself lucky and fortunate to have had people take a genuine interest in him, Mr. Gonzalez was able to complete his degree without any activations or deployments. During his interview, this candidate came across as sincere and genuine in his desire to serve and protect the public. Furthermore, it was our sense that his recruiter and some of his immediate supervisors in the Army recognized the passion and commitment we also observed in this determined individual, as he has already earned the rank of Sergeant in his unit. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Gonzalez to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question, as he received favorable ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. A resourceful and persevering young man, Mr. Gonzalez has made some sacrifices and found ways to better his qualifications and credentials for a law enforcement career by furthering his formal education in criminal justice and by familiarizing himself with the discipline and structure involved in the military and in a corrections facility. We observed him to be a confident and straightforward applicant who should prove to be a pleasure to supervise because of his work ethic and determination to improve himself. Therefore, in light of our favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Gonzalez be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Crystal Lake. ERL/\"',\n",

Personality does change over periods of time as a result of life experiences, successes and failures over the course of life, and major life events and traumas.

Name: Michael Grieco Position: Police Officer Age: 23 Department: Police Department Date: July 19, 2018     : Relatively well-groomed for his appointment, yet his beard was not closely shaved Neatly attired in a suit and tie; professional presentation Physical bearing enhances his credibility as an authoritative police presence Speaks in a flat monotone voice which might hamper his approachability with the public    : Claims that one of his qualities is e2 80 9ccharisma, e2 80 9d yet we found little evidence to support this assertion Instead, he strikes us as rather matter-of-fact, and his tone of voice lacks emotion Overall, he will be honest and straightforward in his dealings with his fellow officers as well as the members of the public Having participated in organized sports as a youngster and through high school, and he enjoys being part of team that has a mutual goal of shared success    : Drawn to the integrity behind the badge Feels particularly compelled to obstruct certain crimes such as drug use, which has plagued his family of origin Overall the candidate is committed to public service As evidence of this, the candidate has helped coach youth football in his spare time  relevant work and life experience  : Associate e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice from Moraine Valley Community College, which was awarded in 2016 Hired as an auxiliary officer at the Crestwood Police Department in May of 2018 In his capacity as an auxiliary officer with the Crestwood PD, he patrols the parking lots at local shopping malls and writes violations In addition, he responds to minor automobile accidents and helps direct traffic    : This person prides himself on working at least 60 hours a week Specifically, he holds two part-time jobs, one with the Crestwood Police Department and the other as a driver for a dialysis care service We see this individual as a go-getter who will show initiative and become a productive officer at the agency over time Reliable candidate who rarely calls off sick for work or is tardy for his assigned shift Because the candidate is conscientious, he tends to dwell on his mistakes    : Raised to respect those in positions of authority Never terminated from any previous place of work Reports only one disciplinary action against him around age 19 or 20 for calling off work without a suitable back-up replacement Responds well to a supervisor who is helpful and answers his questions Wants to be treated fairly  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Has enforced rules while working as an auxiliary officer with the Crestwood PD, as well as having supervisory experience at a restaurant Has no trouble asserting himself when needing to enforce rules and regulations As noted above, the applicant e2 80 99s approachability could use some improvement Will need coaching and guidance on handling potentially dangerous situations, such as domestic interventions At the same time, we do not anticipate the applicant will create an officer safety problem    : Has conducted himself in a responsible fashion throughout most of his life For example, he has never been arrested, although the applicant admits to using marijuana on a handful of occasions before entering college Experienced first-hand the potential devastation caused by illegal drugs within his immediate family; knows the dangers inherent with usage and will steer clear Has behaved responsibly with respect to his finances Overall, he will hold himself accountable for his actions without making excuses for his behavior    : If appointed to the position in question, he will likely remain Claims to have a fairly good support network of friends Appears to have no harmful habits, which would interfere with his ability to perform his position in an acceptable manner Stated consumption of alcohol seems sensible, rarely exceeding four drinks per evening To help reduce any tension and stress in his life, he exercises as many as five to six times a week  Caution about dwelling on his mistakes to the point that that he allow these feelings to adversely impact his mood on the job Coaching and guidance on handling potentially dangerous citizen encounters, such as those experienced during domestic disputes Oversight of his written reports and paperwork in general in order to make sure that he provides complete and appropriately detailed information in these critical documents I    Average  (assesses cognitive abilities)      Spelling          s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Grieco provided straightforward answers to our questions, and an acceptable amount of detail. On the two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed) administered to Mr. Grieco, he demonstrated reasonable writing ability. In these exercises, he typically wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, while being attentive to grammar and syntax. Beyond the basics, Mr. Grieco could stand to elaborate his written accounts. Due to the sensitivity of police documentation, we suggest monitoring his paperwork during his probationary period. The above-reported test scores registered by Mr. Grieco fall below average, yet he received his associate e2 80 99s degree in 2016 while maintaining  grades throughout. Overall, this candidate expresses himself appropriately and with relative ease, and we believe he possesses the proper thinking skills to perform police work. We also anticipate that he will exercise good common sense and sound judgment when addressing assigned duties and tasks.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Grieco to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. The applicant admits that in high school, he was unsure about his choice of a career. While law enforcement was on his mind, he also contemplated teaching or the possibility of working in the trades. However, after taking a couple of criminal justice classes at Moraine Valley Community College, his mind was made up, and he settled into a curriculum that would lead to his associate e2 80 99s degree in the field. At present, this person is serving as an auxiliary officer with the Crestwood Police Department. Mr. Grieco has had some enforcement responsibility in that position, and those tasks requiring him to write citations have been handled appropriately by the applicant upholding the village e2 80 99s rules and ordinances. Although he would benefit from improving his approachability from the public e2 80 99s perception, we believe this individual should develop into a good officer with experience and proper guidance. Mr. Grieco has the requisite skills and mental ability to handle the demands of police work but may need to elaborate when certain details are essential to proper documentation. Regardless, we like this hardworking and committed candidate, and in light of our favorable findings and review of his qualifications, we would recommend that Mr. Grieco be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Chicago Heights. \"',\n",

Name: Billal Haleem Position: Police Officer Age: 30 Department: Police Department Date: April 1, 2019     : Clean-cut, well-groomed personal appearance Neatly attired for his appointment at our office, wearing a dress shirt and tie Speaks clearly and articulately; makes good eye contact when talking to others Projects an authoritative and credible police presence Pleasant and polite manner will allow the applicant to be seen as approachable    : Considerate and respectful of others Will defer to the experience and knowledge of his fellow officers who are more seasoned Will be seen as helpful and accommodating Quiet disposition might be mistaken by some for a lack of friendliness, but after spending time with this person, people will warm to his personality This person is basically shy and will likely put the onus on his peers to reach out to him Able to operate alone during shift, but he also appreciates the opportunity to work as part of a team    : This person has always harbored thoughts of working with the public For example, the candidate first considered a career in teaching history, but felt that the job lacked the impact of working as a police officer Seeks a profession where he can be proactive as opposed to reactive Along this same line, the applicant is attracted to the variety and excitement associated with the job In keeping with his initial interests in teaching, this individual enjoys helping new employees learn their jobs, and as such, he aspires one day to be a police officer FTO; he presently performs that role for the Cook County Sheriff e2 80 99s Department  relevant work and life experience  : Currently, the candidate is a few credits short of earning his A.A.S. degree in criminal justice from Daley College in Chicago Since April of 2011, he has been employed with the Cook County Sheriff e2 80 99s Department Prior to be assigned a place at the jail, the candidate successfully completed the sheriff e2 80 99s training academy at Moraine Valley Community College during 2011 This person has been assigned on two separate occasions to Division 9, the maximum security potion of the correctional facility    : Raised by his parents with a strong work ethic In fact, this person has a habit of becoming so focused on completing his tasks and responsibilities that he can sometimes be accused of tunnel vision along with acting like a perfectionist Overall, the candidate rates exceptionally high on our measures of conscientiousness In particular, he possesses a strong sense of commitment to doing the job right as well as rating high with respect to his level of self-discipline Rarely misses a day of work for illness and he will be seen as punctual and prompt for his shift assignments    : Raised to respect those in positions of authority Throughout his life he has enjoyed positive relations with authority figures from teachers to bosses Respects a hardworking supervisor who leads by his or her own example of commitment to the job Because he will be new to municipal policing, the applicant will appreciate a supervisor who is accessible and approachable  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Although the applicant is untested on the street, he has been assigned to hazardous situations at his present place of work, the Cook County Sheriff e2 80 99s Department According to the candidate, he has not experienced any serious incidents due in large part to how he approaches the inmates at his facility Sets about treating everybody with respect; speaks to inmates without condescension and without antagonizing them which should help minimize officer safety hazards Overall, we observed the candidate to possess a great deal of compassion for others, especially those in need    : At age 30, this person conducts himself in a mature and responsible fashion Throughout his life, he has acted with good judgment and common sense For example, he has never been arrested or used any kind of illegal substances In fact, his most serious offense has been a single traffic ticket on his driving record Presently married; his wife has a 10-year old son from a previous relationship he helps to raise Expected to hold himself accountable for his actions; will not be inclined to make excuses for his behavior    : This person sticks with what he starts; as noted above, he has been in present position with the Cook County Sheriff e2 80 99s Department for the last eight years Family is very important to this person, and he devotes a significant amount of time and effort to participating in his stepson e2 80 99s activities, to include coaching his sports The applicant also enjoys exercise, which he does five to six times a week Due to in large s religious convictions, the candidate does not consume alcohol In sum, this person possesses no harmful habits which might interfere with his ability to perform the position in question  Coaching on managing his time in such a way that he does not allow his high degree of focus on a single task to distract him from his other duties and responsibilities Monitoring his paperwork and report writing to make sure that it is complete with the proper attention to all of the important details I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s online materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Haleem took the time to be accurate. However, his level of detail was not particularly noteworthy. We also administered two other writing samples (both of which were typed). On all of these exercises, this applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability in terms of being able to express his thoughts clearly. However, on his mock police report, he provided too few details. Again, as noted previously, Mr. Haleem did manage to write in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, while also making effective use of the proper grammar and syntax. In light of these observations, we suspect that Mr. Haleem e2 80 99s paperwork and police reports will require monitoring during his probationary period to make sure that he submits a complete and detailed final product. As Mr. Haleem e2 80 99s above-reported test scores indicate, he is quite bright. In fact, the applicant expressed the desire to one day work on his master e2 80 99s degree. Perhaps, this person e2 80 99s strongest point resides with his empathy and compassion, which are both components of a high degree of emotional intelligence.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Haleem to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. This individual has in the past five years endured serious personal hardship with the loss of both his father and his mother at relatively young ages. Mr. Haleem is the oldest of six children, and from an early age, he developed a strong sense of duty, obligation, and responsibility. Respect for others along with valuing the importance of hard work were also strongly emphasized in his family of origin. There is obviously a lot that we like about this individual, who accumulated a fair number of strong ratings in  of this report. As we discussed previously in our findings, this individual has always harbored thoughts about serving the community in one capacity or another. Initially, with his interest in history, Mr. Haleem thought about teaching the topic in a classroom setting. However, after taking a couple of collegiate elective courses relating to criminal justice, Mr. Haleem switched his career interests away from teaching and toward law enforcement. Ironically, this person e2 80 99s teaching interests remain in part as he currently serves as a field training officer as well as deputy sheriff with the Cook County Sheriff e2 80 99s Department. Moreover, Mr. Haleem hopes that once he gains experience with the Alsip Police Department, he might assume a similar role as an FTO. Therefore, in light of our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Haleem be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Alsip. \"',\n",

Name: Aaron Harper Position: Police Officer Age: 24 Department: Police Department Date: November 12, 2019     : Conscientious about the testing process, followed instructions well, and worked within the expressed timelines 40 minutes late for his appointment time at our office, but kept us up to date on his progress; extremely apologetic upon his arrival Appropriately dressed in a suit and tie Overall, comes across as anxious and unsure of himself Fails to project a credible police presence    : There is no question that the candidate is a well-intended individual Most people will perceive him as pleasant and polite On the other hand, the candidate e2 80 99s communication skills are poor The applicant struggles to articulate his thoughts, often using the wrong words when trying to express himself While it might be easy to want to attribute the applicant e2 80 99s anxious way of speaking to his nervousness over being late for his appointment, there are indications that his problems in communicating have been evident to others In short, his past and present coworkers and bosses claim that he is e2 80 9ctoo talkative e2 80 9d Furthermore, these same people assert that he tends to elaborate and digress from the topic at hand, and he needs to get to the point Overall, he will struggle to be accepted by his fellow officers and likely be seen as frustrating    : Rates very high on our measures of altruism Has a history of volunteering his time to assist others in need On the other hand, this person possesses extremely high needs for excitement States that his primary reasons for seeking a career are the appeal of working in a job that is ever changing and presents a diversity of activity The different specialty areas of police work are also appealing to this applicant  relevant work and life experience  : Bachelor e2 80 99s degree in 2017 from Western Illinois University, majoring in law enforcement and justice administration Performed a three-month internship with the Maywood Police Department, also in 2017 Has no jobs related to actual law enforcement, like private security or loss prevention On the other hand, he served as a student manager for catering events while attending Western Illinois University In addition, he has had customer service experience at his first job at Jewel-Osco and later at a Pizza Hut restaurant    : Good work record with Pizza Hut, where he worked for almost three years between May of 2014 and February of 2017 Given supervisory responsibility for his hard work and efforts Praised for being hardworking Rates high on our measures of achievement motivation; he has high aspiration levels and will work hard to achieve his goals On the other hand, no doubt due in part to his anxious personality, the applicant has been criticized for being easily distracted and struggling to stay focused    : This individual will look to his superiors for guidance In his own words, he seeks e2 80 9cstep-by-step e2 80 9d instructions on how to perform his job properly This person possesses a low tolerance for ambiguity; constant communication is a must for him Obedient and compliant, he has never experienced problems at work with authority He has never been terminated at any previous place of employment Moreover, he has not received any disciplinary actions against him  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : This will be a major stumbling block for this candidate, particularly in light of our above-mentioned observations about his poor communication skills Lacking is self-confidence and assertiveness, it is hard to believe that he will be able to adequately handle the enforcement piece of the position in question Lacking a command presence, he will be perceived by the public as tentative and unsure of himself In sum, we see this person as a potential officer safety problem, for himself and others    : There is evidence that this person has exercised poor judgment while attending college at Western Illinois University to study law enforcement In particular, he was arrested twice while at college: once for driving a car that was not his own and charged with vehicular trespassing and on a second occasion for underage drinking Also, during his freshman year at college, after declaring a major in law enforcement and justice administration, the applicant smoked marijuana on at least five different occasions Continues to live at home with his mother; is not involved in any significant long-term relationship at this time Overall, this person e2 80 99s maturity seems questionable for a public safety position of this importance    : Nervous and anxious, he will struggle to meet the expectations of his FTO e2 80 99s and other superiors in the department Lacking in confidence and self-esteem, the enforcement piece of the position in question will be very difficult for him; failure to perform will negatively impact his confidence and self-esteem further Although the applicant badly distorted his personality tests scores in order to make himself look calm and composed, he is a nervous individual who strikes us as unsuited for police work, at least at this point in his life While the candidate has several years of customer service experience, he has not held a position for any length of time to demonstrate that he can effectively cope with the negativity and resistance he will likely encounter on the streets in an adaptive manner At present, he lives at home with his mother and stepfather along with a younger sister; from all indications, his family serves as a source of comfort and support To help relieve tension and stress, this person prefers being active by working out or playing soccer He also spends a considerable amount of time playing online videogames, anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours, 3 - 5 times a week  This individual is not well-suited for a career in Iaw enforcement at this point in his life. He might, however, benefit from an auxiliary position as a CSO (Community Service Officer) to allow time to work on his  and increase his confidence. I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Harper submitted a Personal History Form that was reasonably accurate but lacking in sufficient detail and information. In his behalf, however, Mr. Harper did use proper spelling and grammar. We also administered two other writing samples, which included a mock police report as well as a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career in law enforcement. On both of these exercises, this applicant demonstrated much better writing ability. Not only did he pay attention to using appropriate grammar and syntax, but he performed a far better job of offering the pertinent details and background information. His above-reported score on the  portion of , predicts positively as well for the applicant e2 80 99s aptitude in handling paperwork and report writing. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate demonstrates acceptable EQ. While he is nervous and anxious, he is able at the same time to feel empathy and understanding for other people and their suffering and plight.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Harper to be an unacceptable applicant for the position in question. It would be easy to attribute the applicant e2 80 99s poor performance on our assessment process to being 40 minutes late for his scheduled appointment at our office. Apologetic, perhaps, to a fault, he certainly was unsettled by the start of his day. On the other hand, we have evidence from his past and present bosses that Mr. Harper is a nervous and anxious individual, regardless. Overly talkative, to the point of being bothersome, it is hard for this individual to stay focused and on-track with the topic at hand. We have no doubts that Mr. Harper is a likeable and polite young man. However, we believe he will struggle to complete his probationary period with the Schaumburg Police Department. As we stated previously in this report, he is a nervous and tentative individual who will not be able to handle the enforcement piece of the position. It might be helpful for this person to set his sights lower for the time being and search for openings in auxiliary positions, like those found as a CSO (Community Service Officer). Finally, we have also raised doubts about Mr. Harper e2 80 99s maturity. In particular, his judgment while studying law enforcement and justice administration during college is highly questionable. As noted above, he was arrested twice and used illegal drugs after declaring his major in law enforcement and justice administration. Therefore, in light of our many stated concerns and reservations, we would not recommend that Mr. Harper be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Schaumburg. \"',\n",

Moreover, we found him to be a very coachable and trainable recruit who will apply himself diligently. At the same time, Mr. Heneghan has absolutely no exposure to police operations. A bit of support and patience on the part of his FTO e2 80 99s and line supervisors will be needed with this relatively e2 80 9cgreen e2 80 9d candidate. I Mental Ability  Norms for Police Officers        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Heneghan provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that included relevant details and a degree of elaboration whenever it was necessary. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated average to slightly  writing ability. Although his hand printing style was a bit messy and difficult to decipher at times, this applicant amply demonstrated his ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Once he has been properly trained, we believe Mr. Heneghan will be able to produce professional and informative reports as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Heneghan to possess  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his grades throughout high school and college, and by his scores on our standardized tests (cited above). Mr. Heneghan graduated from Andrew High School in 2012 with strong 3.80 grade point average. While he was at AHS, this individual was involved in a couple of school sports while primarily taking honors and advanced placement courses. In addition, he also worked part-time. Considering a career in public safety, Mr. Heneghan set off for the University of Iowa in 2012 and returned with a bachelor e2 80 99s degree in sociology (criminology emphasis) in 2016, graduating with a reported 3.40 GPA. During his college years, he was a member of a social fraternity and was the captain of the university e2 80 99s club water polo team. All things considered, Mr. Heneghan possesses the ability to master the essential information and skills required to become a police officer.  Mr. Heneghan is the youngest of three children who spent his developmental years in Tinley Park, where he attended local public schools. An outstanding student in high school, Mr. Heneghan began considering a career in public safety work during his early college years. Attributing his interest in police work to his involvement as a peer jurist in affiliation with the Tinley Park Police Department while he was in high school, Mr. Heneghan enjoyed the prospect of being able to make a meaningful difference in the lives of others. Along this line, we found him to be an altruistic person, who is sincere and well-intentioned in his desire to protect and serve the community. In this regard, Mr. Heneghan maintained that he completed a great deal of community service and volunteer work throughout high school and college. Although he has taken some steps to prepare himself for a career as a police officer by furthering his formal education with a criminology emphasis, Mr. Heneghan has not had any practical or relevant experience with law enforcement. At the same time, we believe his perception of what will be expected of him in this line of work is fairly realistic and objective, yet that is difficult to discern because he has never been inside a police cruiser or participated on a ride-along. There is certainly a lot to like about this individual in terms of his engaging interpersonal style, work ethic, and energy level, which predicts favorably for a very trainable and coachable recruit. Other than some experimentation with marijuana in his late high school and early college years, this applicant has kept his nose clean, and he struck us as honest and straightforward. In our experience, individuals with many of the same qualities fare well during their training and education in police work, but at the same time he will require a bit of patience on the part of his supervisors. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Heneghan to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question, as he received acceptable or strong ratings on all but one of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. From a psychological perspective, we believe he has the potential to grow and develop along with the job both personally and professionally. In light of our review, we would recommend that Mr. Heneghan be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Hinsdale, Illinois. \"',\n",

Moreover, we found him to be a very coachable and trainable recruit who will apply himself diligently. At the same time, it will be important to monitor this person e2 80 99s handling of the multi-tasking piece of the position in question; we suggest a degree of patience with this person as he is committed to mastering the essential elements of the job. I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Heneghan submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate and contained a sufficient amount of information and detail. In addition, Mr. Heneghan used proper spelling and grammar on his Personal History Form. We also administered two other writing samples, which included a mock police report as well as a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career in law enforcement. On both of these exercises, this applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability and provided pertinent details. The above-reported scores on s are reassuring and all things considered, the candidate has the ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate has demonstrated strong emotional intelligence; his insight and self-examination regarding the situation in Hinsdale supports this assertion.  Attributing his interest in police work to his involvement as a peer jurist in affiliation with the Tinley Park Police Department while he was in high school, Mr. Heneghan enjoyed the prospect of being able to make a meaningful difference in the lives of others. Along this line, we found him to be an altruistic person who is sincere and well-intentioned in his desire to protect and serve the community. In this regard, Mr. Heneghan maintained that he completed a great deal of community service and volunteer work throughout high school and college. Since his release from the Hinsdale Police Department, this individual has taken definitive steps to prepare himself to serve as a police officer once again. In particular, he joined the University of Chicago Police Department where he has taken steps to improve areas which were cited by the Hinsdale Police Department as shortcomings. For example, Mr. Heneghan was told that he was e2 80 9crobotic e2 80 9d when approaching citizens for routine violations. This is an area he has sought to improve by allowing himself to appear more approachable to the Hyde Park residents he encounters in his duties with the University of Chicago Police Department. There is certainly a lot to like about this individual in terms of his engaging interpersonal style, work ethic, and energy level, which predicts favorably for a very trainable and coachable recruit. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Heneghan to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. At the same time, we recommend that the Tinley Park Police Department check with the Hinsdale Police Department in order to get the full story behind Mr. Heneghan e2 80 99s dismis from the agency. Regardless, from a psychological perspective, we believe he has the potential to grow and develop along with the job both personally and professionally.

We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career. The applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability on this exercise as well, giving the appropriate amount of detail and making effective use of the appropriate grammar and syntax. This kind of performance with regard to his written communication predicts positively for handling the paperwork and report writing piece of the position in question. We are also encouraged by his strong showing on both sections of . With respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate has demonstrated good EQ by referencing his empathy and regard for patients who he treats when while functioning in the EMS part of the job. All things considered, the candidate has the ability to master the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Hively to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. We are a little skeptical of the applicant e2 80 99s explanation for seeking to become a firefighter/paramedic. Mr. Hively reports feeling that he had a e2 80 9cpatriotic calling e2 80 9d for the fire service after the events following 9/11. The fact that the candidate was only six years old at the time is what causes us to be skeptical about his story of first becoming interested in a career in the fire service and EMS. To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, however, he has been diligent about pursuing the proper credentials through education and training as stated above in  of this report. Additionally, the applicant has obtained valuable experience in fighting structural fires and administering to patients in distress at various fire departments and fire protection districts. This person enjoys his chosen profession, but the candidate was critical of the inevitable problem of the lack of sleep, especially when on duty at night. For the most part, this person has been able to get along with his fellow firefighter/paramedics. On the other hand, the applicant acknowledges that he can be hardheaded and stubborn on certain occasions. In those instances where Mr. Hively oversteps his bounds, we believe that Mr. Hively will be open to corrective feedback from his superior officers in the department. Eager to do well and excel at his job, having frank feedback on his performance will be critical to the applicant e2 80 99s professional growth. Therefore, in light of our overall review of this individual, we would recommend that Mr. Hively be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Carol Stream Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

this will not be the case with this candidate In general, this person has not acted responsibly While certain behavior can be attributed to youthful mischief, the majority of his serious offenses have come while he was studying law enforcement in college Received several underage drinking tickets while attending college During college he received a DUI, which resulted from not only driving drunk, but also driving on a suspended driver e2 80 99s license for a previous incident with alcohol Also admits to smoking marijuana while taking classes in criminal justice at Western Illinois University    : Even if this individual were to survive his probationary period and manage to work at his job without any disciplinary actions, he is admittedly eager to move on in his career As mentioned earlier in this report, he wants to look into employment at the federal level, preferably with an agency dealing with drug enforcement Controlling and managing his stress levels will be a challenge, since he seems to irritate rather easily s regularly as both a way to build his body and also reduce his stress levels We are unconvinced that the candidate can control his consumption of alcohol to excess based on his past behavior even though he expressed being contrite about his embarrassing DUI while in college  The overall defensiveness witnessed on the part of this person makes us reluctant to recommend any type of training intervention that is likely to have lasting impact The applicant e2 80 99s inability to accept constructive criticism will impair his ability to grow and develop in his role as a police officer I    Average  (assesses cognitive abilities)    Spelling            s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Hlado e2 80 99s handwriting was extremely messy and hard to decipher. In short, it looked hurried. We administered two writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In these two exercises, this applicant demonstrated differing sets of writing ability. On the handwritten mock police report, the candidate failed to pay attention to the details. In addition, Mr. Hlado did not write in terribly clear, definitive, and complete sentences, or pay particularly close attention to utilizing the proper grammar and syntax. On the other hand, the typed exercise which was prepared on his own time prior to his appointment at our office reflected very strong writing skills. His sentences were complete and informative, and his use of the proper grammar and syntax was acceptable. We can only conclude that the candidate, when given extra time is capable of producing a competent written product. The above-reported test scores range from average to lower than average. While we think that he is book-smart, we have doubts about his judgment and common sense as it tends to be clouded by his emotions. In sum, it is Mr. Hlado e2 80 99s emotional intelligence and lack of empathy that bothers us more than his average to lower than average scores on our battery of standardized mental ability tests.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Hlado to be an unacceptable applicant for the position in question. This person seems to have trouble following the rules. Mr. Hlado e2 80 99s attitude towards rules both on and off the job is that they are for other people, not him. When he has broken the rules and faced such consequences as terminations, disciplinary actions, or arrests by the authorities, Mr. Hlado has been quick to provide a rationale for his behavior. It appears that the applicant is rarely at fault for his actions. When Mr. Hlado got his DUI arrest, it was because it was a snowy day and even though he had been drinking and his license had been suspended, he thought there would be no problem e2 80 9cjust driving a few blocks e2 80 9d for convenience e2 80 99s sake. From the beginning of his assessment at our office Mr. Hlado made a concerted effort to manage his impression in as favorable a light as possible by distorting his test results on our surveys of personality and interpersonal behavior. Between this kind of behavior and his constant excuse-making, we have reason to doubt the veracity of many of his answers. In sum, Mr. Hlado strikes us as a potential problem employee who will not be responsive to training or coaching initiatives. Therefore, in light of our many stated concerns and reservations, we would not recommend that Mr. Hlado be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Country Club Hills. \"',\n",

this will not be the case with this candidate In general, this person has not acted responsibly While certain behavior can be attributed to youthful mischief, the majority of his serious offenses have come while he was studying law enforcement in college Received several underage drinking tickets while attending college During college he received a DUI, which resulted from not only driving drunk, but also driving on a suspended driver e2 80 99s license for a previous incident with alcohol Also admits to smoking marijuana while taking classes in criminal justice at Western Illinois University    : Even if this individual were to survive his probationary period and manage to work at his job without any disciplinary actions, he is admittedly eager to move on in his career As mentioned earlier in this report, he wants to look into employment at the federal level, preferably with an agency dealing with drug enforcement Controlling and managing his stress levels will be a challenge, since he seems to irritate rather easily s regularly as both a way to build his body and also reduce his stress levels We are unconvinced that the candidate can control his consumption of alcohol to excess based on his past behavior even though he expressed being contrite about his embarrassing DUI while in college  The overall defensiveness witnessed on the part of this person makes us reluctant to recommend any type of training intervention that is likely to have lasting impact The applicant e2 80 99s inability to accept constructive criticism will impair his ability to grow and develop in his role as a police officer I    Average  (assesses cognitive abilities)    Spelling            s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Hlado e2 80 99s handwriting was extremely messy and hard to decipher. In short, it looked hurried. We administered two writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In these two exercises, this applicant demonstrated differing sets of writing ability. On the handwritten mock police report, the candidate failed to pay attention to the details. In addition, Mr. Hlado did not write in terribly clear, definitive, and complete sentences, or pay particularly close attention to utilizing the proper grammar and syntax. On the other hand, the typed exercise which was prepared on his own time prior to his appointment at our office reflected very strong writing skills. His sentences were complete and informative, and his use of the proper grammar and syntax was acceptable. We can only conclude that the candidate, when given extra time is capable of producing a competent written product. The above-reported test scores range from average to lower than average. While we think that he is book-smart, we have doubts about his judgment and common sense as it tends to be clouded by his emotions. In sum, it is Mr. Hlado e2 80 99s emotional intelligence and lack of empathy that bothers us more than his average to lower than average scores on our battery of standardized mental ability tests.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Hlado to be an unacceptable applicant for the position in question. This person seems to have trouble following the rules. Mr. Hlado e2 80 99s attitude towards rules both on and off the job is that they are for other people, not him. When he has broken the rules and faced such consequences as terminations, disciplinary actions, or arrests by the authorities, Mr. Hlado has been quick to provide a rationale for his behavior. It appears that the applicant is rarely at fault for his actions. When Mr. Hlado got his DUI arrest, it was because it was a snowy day and even though he had been drinking and his license had been suspended, he thought there would be no problem e2 80 9cjust driving a few blocks e2 80 9d for convenience e2 80 99s sake. From the beginning of his assessment at our office Mr. Hlado made a concerted effort to manage his impression in as favorable a light as possible by distorting his test results on our surveys of personality and interpersonal behavior. Between this kind of behavior and his constant excuse-making, we have reason to doubt the veracity of many of his answers. In sum, Mr. Hlado strikes us as a potential problem employee who will not be responsive to training or coaching initiatives. Therefore, in light of our many stated concerns and reservations, we would not recommend that Mr. Hlado be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Tinley Park. \"',\n",

Name: Alexander Horodysky Position: Police Officer Age: 33 Department: Police Department Date: September 23, 2019     : Arrived an hour early for his appointment time Clean-cut and well-groomed; shaved head with a beard Professionally attired in a suit and tie Detracted from his initial impression by chewing gum throughout his interiew with the psychologist    : Talkative and gregarious disposition On the other hand, his constant reference to his prospective peers as e2 80 9ccops e2 80 9d struck us as unprofessional and demeaning Comes across as self-confident Moderately outgoing and engaging individual who is likely to be more private and selective than he appears on the surface Overall, this person will take a little longer to integrate with his fellow officers    : Gave as an example of his service orientation assisting people prepare their tax returns On the other hand, it is status and reverence that this person seeks According to the candidate, he spoke of the admiration his father receives as a physician In addition, the applicant is attracted to the excitement and variety associated with police work In short, he does not want to continue in a boring career like tax preparation  relevant work and life experience  : This candidate has a lack of relevant education and experience Gaining relevant education and experience requires minimal effort, yet this person has done nothing to extend himself Bachelor e2 80 99s degree in accounting from Lewis University in 2010 This person has been primarily employed as a tax preparer with an accounting firm Has accompanied a friend on ride-alongs with the Oakbrook Terrace Police Department on several occasions Other than those ride-alongs this individual has not had any direct or relevant exposure to police work    : To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he has been consistently employed in some capacity since he was in high school Also, in his favor, he has remained with the same tax preparation business since November of 2011, almost eight years to date While his test results might have been inflated to manage his impression in as favorable of a light as possible, he does score high on our measures of conscientiousness On the other hand, he will not be shy about voicing concerns about his employer if he believes that he is correct in his views    : Relatively rebellious until his mid-20 e2 80 99s, describes himself as a e2 80 9cspoiled rotten kid e2 80 9d Believes he has matured since that time, however, he did not hold back his criticism of current and previous bosses and superiors Often feels that he is not recognized for his talents and attributes; inclined to complain to others In addition, this person probably believes that he knows a better way to do things Has a track record for bending rules to suit his purposes; we have concerns about his adherence to departmental policies and procedures  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : The applicant is articulate with his words and well-spoken Even though he is of smaller physical size and stature, this should not interfere with his ability to project an authoritative bearing The candidate comes across in a confident and assertive manner At the same time, with no prior experience enforcing rules and regulations, it is harder to speculate how this person will perform in enforcement situations, especially ones that will be stressful    : Appears to have been indulged by his parents and has had few struggles in his life other than his attempts to become a sworn police officer Gave a number of excuses for the difficulties that he has encountered without fully acknowledging his own contribution Will struggle to hold himself accountable for his actions Throughout high school and his early college years, the candidate reported using marijuana, cocaine, and anabolic steroids several times For a person looking to uphold the law, this kind of behavior is disturbing to say the least Has had a significant number of traffic citations over the years Arrested for DUI in 2009; licensed suspended for six months Proud of the fact that through the assistance of his attorney he was never convicted Also arrested in 2009 for e2 80 9cobstructing a police officer e2 80 9d due to videotaping an arrest of one of his friends during a night of heavy drinking Currently, he is married and has bought a home; expecting a child    : We have serious concerns about the applicant e2 80 99s overall stability and maladaptive coping mechanisms Has moderated his drinking from his reported consumption in high school and college; however, he still consumes as many as 6 -7 drinks in an evening and 1 -2 times a month; this consumption borders on the definition of binge drinking and a poor choice for someone who has already been arrested for a DUI Stated that all of his closest friends are currently police officers, and he enjoys riding his motorcycle with them for recreation; they should serve as a good base of support Will likely personalize the negativity and resistance he will encounter on the streets May not get through field training or probationary period due to his misguided perception of his own sense of competence and prowess  We have considerable reservations about this individual e2 80 99s suitability for a law enforcement career due to our many reservations cited throughout this report. Many of the deficits are not amenable to training. I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of his assessment at our office, Mr. Horodysky submitted an accurate and moderately detailed account of his personal and professional background on his Personal History Form. We also administered two other writing samples which were typewritten. In each instance, this applicant demonstrated average to  writing ability in terms of adequate depth and coverage of the amount of information that he offered. This candidate is fully capable of expressing himself in clear and complete sentences, and Mr. Horodysky knows how to utilize essential grammar, syntax, and punctuation. With some oversight, this individual should be able to produce professional and informative reports as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Horodysky to possess average to  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his educational and occupational accomplishments to date, and by the way he was able to express his thoughts. In sum, Mr. Horodysky should be able to learn the essential elements associated with this line of work.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Horodysky to be an unacceptable applicant for the position in question. This person was raised with privilege. It is ironic that he states resenting coworkers who think that they are owed something. While the applicant might abhor those who he believes possess a sense of entitlement, it is difficult to characterize this candidate any other way. This is Mr. Horodysky e2 80 99s second visit to our office within the space of a few years. One of the glaring deficits that helped disqualify the applicant from prior consideration as a candidate to become a police officer was his near total lack of job-related education and experience. During the span of time between his first and second trips to our office to be assessed for the job in question, one would think that he might have enrolled in a class on law enforcement or criminal justice. In terms of experience, he might have thought about signing up for a citizen e2 80 99s police academy. Instead, he has done absolutely nothing, which makes us question his commitment and motivations for the job. This is obviously very disappointing. Stating that he has always wanted to become a police officer, most of this candidate e2 80 99s knowledge and exposure to police work comes from his own encounters and arrests with law enforcement, and through the information he has garnered from his friends who are presently employed as police officers. Therefore, once again, we would advise the Police and Fire Commission to take a pass on this individual and continue to search for more suitable, qualified, and mature applicants to serve as a Police Officer in the Village of Tinley Park. \"',\n",

He submitted a Personal History form that was accurate, contained sufficient detail, and was free of spelling or grammar errors. We also administered another writing sample which included a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the applicant e2 80 99s career. In our writing exercise, this applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability including appropriate grammar and syntax as well as pertinent details. All things considered, the candidate has the ability to master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. With respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate has demonstrated good EQ. Mr. Johnston is aware of his presence and behaviorisms as well as how he presents to others. As mentioned in  of this report, there was a moment during the assessment when Mr. Johnston was speaking in longwinded sentences, but he was able to adjust and respond accordingly; shortening his answers and staying on task for the remainder of the assessment. Mr. Johnston has the self-awareness to both understand his interactions with citizens and team members as well as the ability to read social cues.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Johnston to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. Mr. Johnston presents as a talkative but likeable and professional individual who carries himself well. His part-time experience with the City of Batavia since 2007 will help facilitate the acclamation process as he transitions into a full-time employee. During this time, he will be open and malleable to any constructive feedback that he receives from his superiors, and Mr. Johnston expects to learn quickly from his mistakes. Being familiar with the position, he is realistic about the variety of duties on the job, understanding they can range from responding to routine calls from e2 80 9cfrequent flyers, e2 80 9d to remaining professional and calm when resuscitating the child of his son e2 80 99s schoolteacher. Through his experience as a firefighter and paramedic the candidate has handled stressful conditions calmly and remained focused on the task at hand. Mr. Johnston is looking to build an identity as a firefighter with the City of Batavia. The applicant is motivated by the variety and challenges that come with the position and is looking to learn and adapt to the needs and expectations of the department; very much in line with the paramilitary structure that comes with being a firefighter. His willingness and drive to help those in need will be seen as authentic and visible by the citizens who he is serving. Finally, Mr. Johnston e2 80 99s focus on proving his worth will come through to departmental leadership and the crew. Therefore, in light of our overall, favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Johnston be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the City of Batavia. JLA/\"',\n",

Name: Thomas Kelly Position: Firefighter Age: 28 Department: Fire Department Date: Novermber 7, 2019     : Punctual, arrived 20 mins early for his assessment Well-groomed and professionally attired in a suit and tie for his appointment Rather nervous, but came across as congenial, open, and engaging Attempted to project a favorable image, as evidenced by the distortion of his test results Very intent in managing his impression in as favorable a light as possible On , will be viewed as approachable and credible by citizens    : Outgoing and outspoken person; enjoys talking about himself  needs for acceptance and inclusion from others; some concerns about compromising values and morals in an attempt to fit in Spoke about his past two partners and everything that he does not like about them; might not fit in well in a new department Would rather not work with an angry individual who is negative and thinks he knows best; ironically, this is an apt description of how this candidate may act himself Likely to call a lot of attention to himself; may be perceived as boisterous and a bit of a show-off by his peers    : Decided to pursue this line of work around 2014 because his father, who is a firefighter, suggested it after the candidate failed out of school while studying to become a history teacher Made little mention whatsoever of a desire to protect and help others Does not want to sit behind a desk Seeking consistency, stability, and excitement in the workplace Concerns about this individual e2 80 99s capacity to listen and remain compassionate in his interactions with the public; will be superficially respectful, yet we have doubts about his sincerity    : Earned his EMT-B through Northwest Community Hospital in 2015 Received his paramedic license in 2018 through Lutheran General Hospital BOF from NIPSTA during 2018 Employed as an EMT with Superior Ambulance from June of 2015 to March of 2018 Currently works for Barrington Countryside Fire Protection District where he has worked as a firefighter/paramedic for almost a year and one-half    : Views himself as an incredibly conscientious person who goes above and beyond in just about everything he does This grandiose opinion of himself is not exactly represented in his occupational and academic background Likes to stay busy and active; yet we believe he will be distractible and more focused on socializing when he needs to apply himself Selectively motivated; routine and mundane aspects of the job will not be appealing for him Will strive to meet basic performance standards, but not expected to extend himself much beyond that    : Has been able to get along amicably with most of his previous bosses and supervisors Views himself as an open-minded and receptive individual who wants to develop and learn Was not able to cite one shortcoming or weakness about himself personally or professionally In our experience, individuals like this have an unrealistic perception of their own competence and capability and will have inordinate difficulty incorporating criticism Will be quick to make excuses or rationalize mistakes and errors Expected to grieve or beef just about anything that compromises his personal sense of comfort and convenience    : Non-emergency experience in his time with Superior Ambulance Currently works at a low call volume department where he most frequently responds to calls from a nearby assisted living facility During one of his few critical calls a patient expired; a lack of clear communication with the receiving hospital was a contributing factor according to the candidate Concerns about his composure and temperament in the face of critical incidents and pressurized situations May have difficulty listening and following instructions from Lieutenants and senior blue-shirts Also likely to try to take charge of situations beyond his level of competence and expertise    : Quick to point fingers and blame external sources rather than take responsibility for his actions Came across as a bit e2 80 9centitled e2 80 9d; inflated sense of his accomplishments and personal attributes Flunked out of college During previous psychological assessments at our office, the applicant admitted to smoking marijuana e2 80 9cabout 25 times e2 80 9d during his college years On his latest trip to our office, he stated that he only smoked marijuana three times; these kinds of inconsistencies are very concerning and brings his truthfulness into question Concerns about this individual e2 80 99s capacity to hold himself accountable for his actions and his level of straightforwardness    : Has remained with his current department, the Barring Countryside Fire Protection District since April of 2018 Does not seem prone toward prolonged periods of worry or depression as he quickly adopts defense mechanisms as denial and projection when stressed Reportedly has some close friends and lives with his girlfriend of over eight years; she is his main source of support Given some of his personality characteristics and need for much attention, he will probably create more stress and tension among his coworkers than he will actually experience on the job To relax, this person enjoys working out, walking his dog, and being outdoors Special Training, Orientation & Concerns The problems and deficiencies exhibited by this candidate with regard to his suitability for a fire service career are numerous. Most of his difficulties involve deeply ingrained personality characteristics that are not likely to be amenable to change through training and education. Self-serving individual who will struggle with self-discipline, co-worker relationships, and ability to incorporate constructive criticism. I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Kelly took the time to complete his required paperwork. The candidate did so in a detail-oriented way and used complete sentences and proper grammar and syntax when expressing himself. On the other hand, because Mr. Kelly enjoys the variety and excitement that a job in the fire service has to offer, paperwork and reports are likely to be problematic for him as will be other mundane and routine job functions. Regardless, we evaluate Mr. Kelly to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his occupational accomplishments to date and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. Overall, this person has the ability to learn the essential information and skills to function capably as a firefighter and medic. At the same time, we evaluate this applicant to be an underachiever, who may not always apply himself with the determination and perseverance required in this line of work, especially if he sees no personal gain or gratification in it.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Kelly to be an unacceptable applicant for the position in question as he received unfavorable ratings on most of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. This rather manipulative individual has failed several previous psychological evaluations, which he attributed previously to his propensity toward verbosity. Problematically, we believe that his penchant to talk at length led to his inconsistencies and fabrications in his storyline which raises concerns about his honesty and ability to accept responsibility for his actions. We found it notable that this applicant never considered the fire service as a career choice until he was not allowed to return to Northern Illinois University in his half-hearted attempt to become a history teacher. As our report indicates, this candidate appears to have a very different perception of himself in comparison to how others may view him. Our primary concern is that if hired, Mr. Kelly may prove to be a headache to supervise. In our experience, opinionated and outspoken individuals can emerge as difficult employees. Unfortunately, we believe that will be the case for Mr. Kelly. Finally, he can come across as ingratiating and manipulative, which will be readily apparent to anyone who encounters him on the job. Therefore, in light of our cautious review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would not recommend that Mr. Kelly be given an offer to work as a part-time Firefighter for the Countryside Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

this observation is inconsistent with his academic background and on-line assessment documents completed for us Focused heavily on the importance of hierarchy and following orders In contrast, he mentioned he enjoys being the paramedic in charge where he can delegate tasks and make decisions Scored  in expressed need for control versus wanted control; in our experience, individuals with this profile have a difficult time taking feedback Not an introspective and realistic individual, mostly able to evaluate his strengths while struggling to remember his weaknesses Difficulty acknowledging, envisioning, and recalling his own contribution to problems or setbacks;

has not been tested with more severe cases Due to the lack of mentioning his desire to protect and help others and his lack of experience in highly traumatic situations, we have concerns about this individual e2 80 99s bedside manner in dealing with patients in terms of empathy, compassion, and the ability to convey reassurance Working on getting back into good physical condition, enjoys Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and is a few classes away of obtaining his purple belt In his latest trip to our office, November 2019, he stated he only smoked marijuana three times; this time he admitted to smoking e2 80 9cabout 25 times e2 80 9d during college; these kinds of inconsistencies are very concerning and bring his truthfulness into question Has had three speeding tickets Consumes two to four drinks, three to five times a month Admitted he has driven while under the influence Possesses some potentially harmful habits that would impair his performance on the job Additional Concerns The candidate disclosed that he currently receives treatment for a rare blood clotting disorder that produces lower platelets than normal and can lead to easy bruising. Within the last year he has been identified as not cleared for duty by a medical doctor due to this disorder. He is receiving new treatment medication with his current doctor and is waiting for results on the long-term viability of the treatment, e.g. less bruising, to make a decision on whether he is cleared for duty. In our assessments, we noted that the problems and deficiencies exhibited by this candidate with regard to his suitability for a fire service career are numerous. Most of his difficulties involved deeply ingrained personality characteristics that are not likely to be amenable to change through training and education. We also noted the candidate was a self-serving individual who will struggle with self-discipline, co-worker relationships, and the ability to incorporate constructive criticism. As stated in certain areas of  of this report, these concerns remain. Importantly, this time around the applicant was given access to our previous report and recommendations leading him to focus on managing his impression. As such, the honesty in his responses are questionable. Due to the lack of mentioning his desire to protect and help others and his lack of experience in highly traumatic situations, we have concerns about this individual e2 80 99s bedside manner in dealing with patients in terms of empathy, compassion, and the ability to convey reassurance. I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Kelly took the time to complete his required paperwork. Through this process, the candidate used complete sentences but often committed grammatical and syntaxial errors when expressing himself. Moreover, some of the information provided in the Personal History Form was misleading. For example, Mr. Kelly mentioned he does not make enough money to support a family, but he is not married and does not have any children. Regardless, we evaluate Mr. Kelly to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his occupational accomplishments to date and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. Although he did not meet the minimum requirements in our quantitative section, this person has the ability to learn the essential information and skills to function capably as a firefighter and medic.  Based on our current observation and assessment, Mr. Kelly appeared to be more of an acceptable applicant for the position in question than noted in prior assessments of him. However, we caution Hoffman Estates to take this recommendation at face value. Mr. Kelly altered his behavior based on insight gained from accessing the outcomes from our most recent report. Specifically, the candidate admitted to going over the results of the assessment conducted in November of 2019 with the Fire Chief of the department to which he has most recently applied, which is a direct violation of our written and stated policy regarding the use of assessment reports on the Chief e2 80 99s part. With that said, several concerns remain. As we noted in , there have been inconsistencies with prior evaluations due to Mr. Kelly manipulating the information he gives, calling his truthfulness into question. In contrast with other suitable candidates for the position in question, this applicant never mentioned his desire to serve others. Moreover, Mr. Kelly did not consider the fire service as a career choice until he was academically dismissed from Northern Illinois University. As our report indicates, this candidate appears to have a very different perception of himself in comparison to how others may view him. Although Mr. Kelly was coached, rehearsed his answers, and managed his impression, his inability to view himself objectively and identify how he contributes to setbacks or conflicts remains clear. In the past, Mr. Kelly has failed several psychological evaluations due to his arrogant, outspoken, and boisterous nature. Initially for this assessment, Mr. Kelly managed his impression well and presented as professional and cooperative; however, as the assessment continued, many of the previously noted concerns about the applicant emerged. As such, this leads us to believe that while on the job it would not take long for these previously noted behavioral concerns to manifest. In light of the revelations that the client was coached based on prior outcomes, he managed his impression based on those findings, and he altered his presentation so that previous concerns about his arrogance were not apparent, we believe the assessment process has been compromised. Due to these highly irregular circumstances, we leave the final decision on hiring Mr. Kelly to the Village of Hoffman Estates. JA/\"',\n",

Because the report may contain certain developmental recommendations or special cautions concerning an applicant, we advise that only those managers involved in the supervision of the individual have access to the report.

Under no circumstances should the information or contents of this report be shared with the applicant unless under the direct supervision of a trained psychologist. We recommend that this report be considered valid for one year. While many of the characteristics of the applicant will not change significantly during that time, others may change enough to alter an individual\\'s qualifications (e.g. , maturation, personal circumstances). Personality does change over periods of time as a result of life experiences, successes and failures over the course of life, and major life events and traumas. In the case of public safety candidates, the exposure to tragic, traumatic, and emotionally charged events in the line of duty, coupled with the need for a quick adaptation to a paramilitary culture predicts for an increased likelihood of adjustment difficulties and possible personality changes quicker than other professions. Moreover, because of the unique combination of skills required for each position, this report pertains to the job in question, only.

will have inordinate difficulty incorporating criticism Will be quick to make excuses or rationalize mistakes and errors Union mindset before he has even been part of a labor organization; expected to grieve or beef just about anything that compromises his personal sense of comfort and convenience    : Non-emergency experience in his time with Superior Ambulance; currently works at a low call volume department where he most frequently responds to calls from a nearby assisted living facility One of the few critical calls that he led this year unfortunately resulted in the death of his patient; a lack of clear communication with the receiving hospital was a contributing factor according to the candidate Concerns about his composure and temperament in the face of critical incidents and pressurized situations May have difficulty listening and following instructions from Lieutenants and senior blue-shirts Also likely to try to take charge of situations beyond his level of competence and expertise    : Quick to point fingers and blame external sources rather than take responsibility for his actions Came across as a bit e2 80 9centitled e2 80 9d;

I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Kelly took the time to complete his required paperwork. The candidate did so in a detail-oriented way and used complete sentences and proper grammar and syntax when expressing himself. On the other hand, because Mr. Kelly enjoys the variety and excitement that a job in the fire service has to offer, paperwork and reports are likely to be problematic for him as will be other mundane and routine job functions. In sum, his selective motivation will impair his ability to perform routine and mundane tasks. Regardless, we evaluate Mr. Kelly to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his occupational accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. Overall, this person has the ability to learn the essential information and skills to function capably as a firefighter and medic. At the same time, we evaluate this applicant to be an underachiever, who may not always apply himself with the determination and perseverance required in this line of work, especially if he sees no personal gain or gratification in it.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Kelly to be an unacceptable applicant for the position in question as he received unfavorable ratings on most of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. This rather manipulative individual has failed at least three previous psychological evaluations, which he attributed to his propensity toward verbosity. Problematically, we believe that his penchant to talk at length led to his inconsistencies and fabrications in his storyline which raises concerns about his honesty and ability to accept responsibility for his actions. We found it notable that this applicant never considered the fire service as a career choice until he was not allowed to return to Northern Illinois University in his half-hearted attempt to become a history teacher even though his father remains a career firefighter in nearby Elk Grove Village. Despite all of his verbiage, this applicant did not once make any mention of his desire to serve and protect lives and property of citizens. Instead, he talked at length about all of the many personal benefits he expects with a good public safety job e2 80 93 ary, benefits, work schedule, pension, union representation, etc. Furthermore, this candidate appears to have a very different perception of himself in comparison to how others may view him. Our primary concern is that if hired Mr. Kelly may prove to be a headache to supervise. In our experience, opinionated and outspoken individuals can emerge as difficult employees. Unfortunately, we believe that will be the case for Mr. Kelly. Therefore, in light of our cautious review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would not recommend that Mr. Kelly be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Mount Prospect, Illinois. \"',\n",

Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Kelly to be an unacceptable applicant for the position in question as he received unfavorable ratings on several of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. At the age of 28, Mr. Kelly is living with his long-term girlfriend in Palatine, Illinois. He has failed three previous psychological evaluations, which might be due in part to the applicant e2 80 99s admission that he did not stop talking. Unfortunately, Mr. Kelly has been unable to incorporate this lesson during his evaluation at our office; because, once again, he talked incessantly. Mr. Kelly seems to enjoy working in the fire service and wants to earn a spot on a different department to make this his long-term career.

Now that he has found a viable career niche for himself, this individual will enjoy mental challenges and problem-solving on the job. May require or seek out opportunities for specialization rather quickly. I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Klontz submitted a Personal History Form that was neatly typed and fairly comprehensive, as he provided essential details and a degree of elaboration when it was required. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career. The applicant demonstrated  writing ability, as he consistently expressed himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, punctuation, and syntax. Mr. Klontz is not expected to have difficulty producing professional and informative reports and documentation as a firefighter and medic. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Klontz to possess  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his academic and occupational achievements to date, and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. Mr. Klontz took primarily honors classes at Lane Tech High School graduating from there with a reported 4.40 (4.00 scale) GPA in 2005. During his high school years, he was involved in aquatic sports and worked as a lifeguard for the Chicago Park District seasonally. Although he was an excellent student, Mr. Klontz acknowledged that the biggest challenge he has faced in his life involved deciding upon a suitable and viable career path for himself. Mr. Klontz earned his bachelor e2 80 99s degree from the University of Illinois with a major in communication in 2009, and he also took two semesters of pre-nursing courses from Truman College in 2013. As evidenced by his recent commitment to the pursuit of a fire service career, this applicant has quickly earned his BOF and EMT-P license. This individual is more than capable of mastering the essential information and skills to earn advanced fire service certifications.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Klontz to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. At the age of 32, Mr. Klontz was candid and forthcoming in discussing the vocational challenges he experienced in his life dating back to his college years. As noted in I and III of this report, Mr. Klontz had an early interest in the fire service during his time in Urbana-Champaign while volunteering for a rural fire district, and he also found gratification in working as a lifeguard for the Chicago Park District for a couple of years. However, the economic recession in and around the time he earned his bachelor e2 80 99s degree made jobs in his major field of study very hard to find. Consequently, Mr. Klontz just e2 80 9ckicked around e2 80 9d for a couple of years finding any type of work he could perform in order to support himself. It was not until two years ago when he firmly committed himself to the pursuit of a fire service career. Stating that he was hindered because of his misguided belief that he was e2 80 9cfearful of the sight of blood, e2 80 9d Mr. Klontz found very quickly during his EMT-B training that was not the case at all. In fact, this individual has handled several rather stressful and gory circumstances and has performed capably thus far as a contract firefighter and medic. On his behalf, Mr. Klontz has learned some valuable lessons along the way, as he struck us as a mature, stable, and task-focused person who is eager to move forward with a profession he now resonates with. In light of our review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Klontz be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Schaumburg, Illinois. \"',\n",

I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Ms. Lorence provided a neatly typed account of her personal and professional life which was detailed and thorough. In the other two written exercises she was required to complete this individual consistently demonstrated the ability to express herself in complete sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Although she can be a bit verbose in elaborating details at times, this applicant is expected to produce professional and informative reports and documentation as a firefighter and medic. Overall, we evaluate Ms. Lorence to possess  mental ability. This assertion is supported by her academic and occupational accomplishments to date, and by her outstanding scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. Ms. Lorence has been an excellent student throughout her academic years after graduating from Sycamore High School in 2008 with a reported 3.60 GPA. An energetic and motivated person, she obtained her EMT-B certification her senior year and also worked part-time in a nursing home. Although her father (who is a career firefighter) wanted her to pursue another line of work, Ms. Lorence was committed to following in his footsteps and went on to obtain two associate e2 80 99s degrees (one in EMS) while working throughout and being the recipient of some scholarship funding. Given the advanced certifications she has accumulated thus far in her career, and the experience she has had with four departments, we believe Ms. Lorence has already demonstrated her ability to master the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  Ms. Lorence is the elder of two children who was born, raised, and continues to reside in Sycamore, Illinois, where she attended local public schools. As mentioned previously, this candidate was raised in a household devoted to service to the community. Even though her parents strongly hinted that she should pursue some alternative vocational pursuit, Ms. Lorence was never convinced that she wanted to do anything else. When her mother e2 80 99s father was killed by a drunk driver while she was in high school, this tragic event seemed to cement her commitment to a fire service career. Since that time, Ms. Lorence has relentlessly pursued her qualifications and credentials to be become a career firefighter. Although she comes across as pleasant and laid-back, Ms. Lorence is very determined and tenacious in bettering herself in this line of work. After five years as a full-time firefighter in Oak Brook, Ms. Lorence feels that it is now time to take on new challenges and objectives, and she came across as enthusiastic about the prospect of working for a much larger, more diverse, and well-respected fire department where she can continue her development. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Lorence to be a strong applicant for the position in question, as she received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a career firefighter and medic. At the age of 28, this applicant has gone above and beyond in order to better her skills and qualifications and we anticipate that it will not take very long for her to earn the respect and trust of her peers at the Schaumburg Fire Department. Overall, we liked the balance she brings to the position in terms of her experience, commitment, modesty, and likable interpersonal style. We believe Ms. Lorence has a very bright future in the fire service, as we also believe she will manifest some leadership potential in the years ahead. In light of our positive review, we would recommend that Ms. Lorence be extended an offer of employment to serve as a Firefighter with the Schaumburg Fire Department. \"',\n",

such as drug and DUI arrests along with apprehending gang members Prides himself on his punctuality; typically arrives at least 30 minutes prior to shift in order to be fully prepared for his day Overall, he has been described as hardworking and dedicated by his peers and supervisors at his agency; should prove to be a productive officer    : Raised to respect authority by his hardworking parents; father spent his entire career in law enforcement Spoke positively about his present police sergeants Responds well to an approachable supervisory style, and appreciates a leader who does not belittle him when he asks questions Does not like to see supervisors playing favorites with members of their shifts As long as this candidate feels valued for his contributions and efforts, he will show the proper deference to his superiors  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Large physical size will be a natural deterrent to those who wish to challenge the applicant e2 80 99s authority Will use tact and discretion in his approach to police work and will not abuse his authority For example, he is particularly adept at talking down parties who are engaged in a heated exchange, such as in a domestic dispute Deals with several domestic disputes each week in his current position and is expected to handle these situations with good judgement and appropriate action    : Has taken the proper steps to prepare himself for a career in law enforcement Admitted to smoking marijuana up to ten times during high school, but stopped using the substance before beginning his studies in criminal justice Has a clean record; no reported arrests and only two verbal warnings on his driving record Has handled his finances responsibly with only a student loan to repay Holds himself accountable for his actions and is unlikely to make excuses in order to defend himself    : With a father who is currently a police chief in west suburban Hillside, Illinois, the applicant has an available support person to turn to in the event he is experiencing stress on the job Currently resides at home with his family Involved in a supportive, long-term relationship with someone he met during high school Has no harmful habits which would impair his ability to perform the position in question Consumes alcohol in moderation, drinking no more than four alcoholic beverages over the course of an evening when out with other people Relies on a variety of relaxing activities to reduce tension and stress, to include regular exercise as well as boating with the other members of his family  Caution to slow down and take his time to prepare paperwork in a thorough and complete fashion I    Average  (assesses cognitive abilities)    Spelling          s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Lukaszek e2 80 99s handwriting was small legible. Overall, we administered two writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On both of his exercises, this applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability, as he wrote in reasonably clear, definitive, and complete sentences, and used proper grammar and syntax. In the mock police report prepared by Mr. Lukaszek, his work appeared rushed, and there were noticeable strikeouts on the page. In his behalf, the candidate was generally attentive to the important details. We suspect that since the written exercise, which was typed, was done on his own time with no need to rush, he produced a much better piece of work than his handwritten exercise. Regardless, we evaluate Mr. Lukaszek to possess the necessary thinking skills in order to handle the demands of the job. Mr. Lukaszek received  grades throughout college and completed both his A.A. and B.A. degrees. His ability to use good judgment and common sense was also apparent while explaining various difficult scenarios related to his work as a police officer. We believe Mr. Lukaszek has the capacity to learn the essential functions of a law enforcement professional and apply them appropriately to his career progression.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Lukaszek to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received acceptable or strong ratings on all our dimensions related to success as a police officer. According to the applicant, he has always had an interest in law enforcement, citing the fact that both his father and his grandfather served in law enforcement roles. At present Mr. Lukaszek e2 80 99s father is the Chief of Police in Hillside, Illinois. Despite his early leanings towards police work, it was Mr. Lukaszek e2 80 99s father who urged him to enroll in college and study something other than law enforcement. After a short stay at DePaul University, where the applicant was enrolled in pre-law, Mr. Lukaszek soon left to pursue his true ambition. While studying criminal justice at Lewis University, Mr. Lukaszek took a job as a part-time police officer in Stone Park, Illinois. This would begin his career in law enforcement, where he continues to this day as a police officer in Villa Park, Illinois. However, Oswego is where Mr. Lukaszek has spent the majority of his youth, and this is where he wishes to work for the remainder of his career. The candidate attended high school in the community and played baseball, where he was a four-year member of the varsity baseball team. Mr. Lukaszek e2 80 99s many years in sports has given him an appreciation for teamwork which has carried over to his career in law enforcement. Finally, Mr. Lukaszek has a positive and healthy attitude towards community policing which will serve him well in his new role in Oswego. Therefore, in light of our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Lukaszek be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Oswego. \"',\n",

We expect him to catch on quickly and comfortably integrate into the department. From our perspective, this individual has the capacity to master essential job functions required. I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials provided as part of our assessment, Mr. Lyman submitted a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background, which contained the essential details, along with some elaboration when it was necessary. In other written exercises as well, Mr. Lyman demonstrated the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Mr. Lyman possesses the ability to produce professional and informative reports and documentation. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Lyman to possess  mental ability, which he will be able to rely on when learning new information for the skills required for the position in question. This assertion is supported by his  test scores on , his occupational history to date, and by the manner in which he was able to express his thoughts and ideas, both orally and written, during his assessment. Mr. Lyman can employ his intellectual abilities when he sets his mind to something. Admittedly, transitioning from military to civilian life was challenging for this candidate; however, when he decided to pursue a career in the fire service, he was able to complete the necessary academic requirements for this career. We believe Mr. Lyman will be able to master the essential information necessary to perform the job duties of a firefighter/paramedic.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Lyman to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. Mr. Lyman currently resides in Bolingbrook, Illinois, with his father and younger sister. The middle of three children, Mr. Lyman was raised in Bolingbrook where he lived with his parents and two siblings until his parents separated while he was in high school. Mr. Lyman graduated from Bolingbrook High School in 2010 and began his time serving in the Marine Corps a few months after graduation. Transitioning back to civilian life after serving for four years in the Marine Corps was the toughest challenge this candidate admits to facing in his life. During that time, he experienced both a divorce and significant career change, and although this transition was quite an adjustment, Mr. Lyman seemed to have undergone some maturing, which helped him to commit to pursuing a civilian career. While attending college, Mr. Lyman became drawn to fire service work, and has not looked back since. Acting on his decision, this candidate shifted his courses and focus at the College of DuPage in order to earn his certification and licenses required to be a paramedic. Given Mr. Lyman e2 80 99s roots and familiarity with the Bolingbrook area, protecting the citizens of the community in his hometown is very important to him. Though his experience is rather limited, he reportedly learned a great deal working with Elite Ambulance and while completing his ride time with the Frankfort Fire Department. Finally, we expect Mr. Lyman to continue to develop into a reliable and competent employee. He has high hopes of finding a career position as a firefighter/paramedic at the Village of Bolingbrook. In light of our review, we would recommend that Mr. Lyman be given an offer to work as a firefighter for the Village of Bolingbrook. ERL/\"',\n",

Name: Tenisha Mcarthur Position: Police Officer Age: 30 Department: Police Department Date: April 22, 2019     : Neatly groomed and professionally attired for her appointment at our office Very animated and energetic demeanor; she will be seen as approachable by members of the public Communicated effectively; however, admitted she was nervous and burst into giggles throughout the evaluation Her excitable disposition could detract from her credibility as a police officer    : Given her outgoing and bubbly nature, she prefers to get along with her coworkers and will do her best to ensure an amiable and positive work environment A likeable and compassionate individual; she is likely to get along well on a new department On the other hand, she is quite loquacious and can stray from the topic at hand at times Extroverted tendencies can come across as her being excitable; she will need to learn to monitor this trait on the job It should be noted that she employed impression management when responding to our standardized personality tests; she also seemed to do so in person by monitoring her talkativeness during the interview portion of our assessment    : Grew up in public housing and respected police officers in the area who offered a feeling of safety and security to her Wanting to give that feeling of safety to others, she began pursuing a career as a law enforcement officer Interested in helping others and carrying out her duty to protect and serve the public Perceives the job of a police officer as e2 80 9ca little terrifying e2 80 9d given the unknowns of the job, but this does not deter her  relevant work and life experience  : Held multiple jobs working in warehouses since 2011 and is accustomed to working in a male-dominated environment Associate e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice from the College of Lake County received in 2016 Has completed six ride-alongs at various departments; she responded to one domestic disturbance during one of them Did not complete an internship or gain any other job-relevant experiences No experience handling or responding to emergencies similar to ones she will face as a law enforcement professional    : Gainfully employed since she graduated high school; she has worked two jobs at some points in order to support her and her daughter According to the candidate, she does not show up late nor take sick days Not afraid of heavy lifting or getting her hands dirty in order to get a job done Motivated to earn a supervisory role at her current place of employment The one issue we see is that she seems to be discouraged by failure; claimed this was her reason for waiting to apply to more departments after failing an entry-level test    : Spoke positively about her supervisors Prefers to work with a supervisor who is friendly, supportive, e2 80 9cdown-to-earth, e2 80 9d and sets clear and attainable expectations Lacks experience working in a paramilitary setting, and her talkative nature and tendency to giggle could detract from her credibility with superior officers Reported one termination from her cashier job at Menards in 2009; while the candidate was ringing up purchases, she failed to notice many small items a customer had hidden in larger ones with the intent of shoplifting them if they were overlooked Other than the above incident, this individual reported no other disciplinary write-ups The morning after her assessment, she sent us a self-endorsing email reiterating her excitement for the job which enhanced our concerns about her ability to contain herself in a professional setting and within structured boundaries While not an egregious breach of our waiver agreement form (signed by all candidates), this was highly unusual and a very rare occurrence given the content of our waiver  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : We believe that she will not back down when being pushed too far, yet this is unlikely to happen given her likable and agreeable nature A common misconception that others have of this person is that she is e2 80 9csmall and weak e2 80 9d when really, she is e2 80 9cvery strong e2 80 9d; we see her as being able to hold her own She has supervised nine direct reports just under a year, and has proven herself able to handle challenging situations with tact Her talkativeness and hyper energy has the potential to affect her composure when enforcing rules, but we believe that she will respond to the proper training Lacks any additional experience supervising or enforcing rules    : Became pregnant at the end of her high school career; she still completed high school and made parenting her daughter her priority Has minimal unpaid financial obligations and stays away from illegal drugs and alcohol Reported two arrests during high school; one for starting a fight, and the other for shoplifting (charges were dropped after proof surfaced indicting her friend of the crime) While she may initially defend herself and seek to justify her actions before accepting critical feedback, she seems open to incorporating helpful feedback given her desire to do her job well    : Resilient individual who has witnessed her fair share of stressful situations throughout her lifetime, such as gang activity, prostitution, and violence Her vigilance and common sense will serve her well in confronting stress on the job However, this person can become unraveled at times when she is nervous, resulting in inappropriate laughter and the tendency to talk too much The follow-up email she sent to us after her interview reflects her struggle to contain herself under certain types of stress Enjoys strong support from her family To relax, she watches television, reads, writes, prays, and spends time with her daughter  This person will require clear expectations, particularly regarding interpersonal interactions. For example, she will need to monitor when she is acting hyper or too talkative on the job. Although this is a capable individual, she will need to adjust her behaviors for others to take her seriously. Providing guidance about acting professionally will need to be a part of her training. She will need to monitor her nerves and how they impact her self-presentation on the job I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, she took the time to fill out her paperwork completely. She provided thoughtful and accurate responses in her paperwork, though she lacked proper use of grammar in her written responses. Regardless, this candidate was able to get her points across in writing. We also administered two other writing samples (both of which were typed). In all of her exercises, this applicant demonstrated adequate writing ability by being attentive to most details, and writing in clear, definitive, and complete sentences. Ms. Mcarthur is a bright individual who is a quick thinker; her test scores reflect this observation. Nonetheless, she will need to work on her grammar and spelling a bit in order to ensure the quality of her reports. In addition to her intellectual abilities, Ms. Mcarthur is particularly motivated and ambitious. Moreover, she possesses some traits that are indicative of emotional intelligence, including compassion and empathy. Overall, we evaluate Ms. Mcarthur to possess the cognitive skills to learn the required duties of the job in question, yet we believe that some of her personality traits and behavior will make it difficult for her to consistently employ those abilities.  Based on our observations and overall assessment, we evaluate Ms. Mcarthur to be an unacceptable applicant for the position in question at this time. This candidate is certainly resilient and energetic, as she maintains a positive attitude even in the face of obstacles, of which she has experienced many. Ms. Mcarthur grew up in public housing with her mother, stepfather, five brothers, and one sister. After becoming pregnant during high school, Ms. Mcarthur relied on her resourcefulness and this single mother moved to the suburbs with her child so she could properly support herself and her daughter. She values motivation and positivity, and has not let anything get in the way of her ability to care for her child. This candidate earned an associate e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice from the College of Lake County which she funded entirely herself. With all of that being said, there are some concerning personality characteristics that Ms. Mcarthur will need to address adequately before becoming a police officer. Her inability to contain herself shows as talkativeness and high energy, which will come across as unprofessional and likely impact her credibility. She will need guidance on how to approach situations in a more serious way in order to assert herself and give members of the public a feeling of security. We believe that gaining additional experience in an auxiliary position will teach her what is expected of her. In short, Ms. Mcarthur will need to learn to show greater composure. The email she sent to our office after her appointment endorsing herself for the position highlighted our observations of her behavior, as in 40 years of business, very few candidates have done so. With that being said, Ms. Mcarthur needs to prove that she can contain her excitement before being placed in a sworn role. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would not recommend that Ms. Mcarthur be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Zion. ERL/\"',\n",

will adhere to departmental policies and procedures  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Not much experience in the enforcement of rules or maintaining order Conversely, he has had considerable experience working under pressure and highly stressful situations Confident, rational, and decisive;  critical thinking skills Not likely to exert a strong command presence but will be taken seriously when his authority is challenged Once he has been properly trained and had some street experience under his belt, we expect this area to emerge as a strength for this individual    : Began assuming responsibility for himself and his actions at an early age Applicant came across as an honest and straightforward person who will hold himself accountable for his actions and decisions Open and candid in reporting some of the regrets and disappointments he has had in his life thus far e2 80 93 even those rare situations he found embarrassing to report Self-sufficient and responsible since his early college years Married for the past four years and the father of two young children;

not likely to personalize negativity and resistance Given his lack of exposure to law enforcement operations, we do have some concerns about the accuracy of his perception of what life will be like for him as a municipal police officer Supportive base of family and several close friends Keeps himself in very good physical condition; enjoys outdoor activities with his family as a means of relaxation TASK FLEXIBILITY ability to handle multiple, simultaneous tasks  : Organized, systematic, and disciplined individual who will prioritize his work in a logical and rational manner Tends to be a bit too analytical and careful with respect to details and thoroughness which may compromise his efficiency at times We believe this characteristic diminished his performance on our Simulation s Applicant has demonstrated the ability to multi-task in other work venues Expected to record and transmit vital information accurately (orally and on paper)  Relatively unfamiliar with police work other than what he has learned from a close friend serving as a Wheaton police officer. Obviously, he has a lot to learn. On his behalf, this applicant is very bright and catches on quickly. Does not project a particularly strong command presence.

In addition, this applicant supplied a professional resume which contained further details about his career and experiences. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated excellent writing ability, as his ability to express himself in complete sentences with proper syntax, grammar, and punctuation was rather polished.

An  student at Willowbrook High School, Mr. McIntyre co-captained the school e2 80 99s wrestling team and was involved in other extracurricular activities involving academic competition in mathematics and German. Upon graduating in 2006, Mr. McIntyre departed for his basic and advanced training as a Marine Corps Reservist in the area of social operations and reconnaissance. Stating that he would one day like to obtain a doctorate in mathematics, Mr. McIntyre was also drawn to engineering and went on to further his formal education in that area with a bachelor e2 80 99s degree in industrial engineering from UIC in 2014 (in between a deployment to Afghanistan where he was seriously wounded in combat). While working at USPS, Mr. McIntyre was particularly proud of the attainment of his Lean Six Sigma Black Belt which he obtained last year after conducting a challenging and comprehensive project which helped to improve the overall efficiency and operations of the Post Office. All things considered, this bright and diligent individual will not have difficulty mastering the essential information and skills required to become a police officer.  Mr. McIntyre is the second of three children who spent his developmental years in Willowbrook where he attended local public schools. An  student, Mr. McIntyre e2 80 99s first plan of action was to enlist in the Marine Corps Reserves right out of high school, which he did. Trained as a reconnaissance specialist assigned to special operations, Mr. McIntyre had to make the grade in each phase of his training in order to be allowed into this sensitive and challenging specialty, which he did. From there he began pursuing his formal education in engineering and mathematics. While enrolled in the industrial engineering program at UIC, Mr. McIntyre volunteered to be activated during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2011 because he felt the need to serve his country even though it delayed his degree progression. After three months in Afghanistan, Mr. McIntyre sustained a gunshot wound to the leg in an ambush, which required a good deal of rehabilitation. A Purple Heart recipient, Mr. McIntyre would now like to focus his energy on serving the community with the same pride and honor he once served his country. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. McIntyre to be a strong candidate for the position in question, as he received favorable ratings on most of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. While we are aware that this is quite a dramatic career change for Mr. McIntyre, he has discussed the matter with his wife of four years, and he has been actively applying for selected police officer positions for the past year or two. Recently, he declined further processing by the Illinois State Police because of the strong likelihood of relocation. While he rates relatively high on several other suburban hiring lists, his preference would be to serve the citizens in his current home community of Carol Stream, and came across as committed and enthusiastic about this chance to do so. A bright, competent, determined, and amiable individual this candidate presented with excellent potential for developing into a productive and capable addition to the department. In fact, we anticipate that with his high needs for achievement and strong work ethic, this individual is likely to ascend in rank over the long-term. In light of our review, we would recommend that Mr. McIntyre be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Carol Stream, Illinois. \"',\n",

Because the report may contain certain developmental recommendations or special cautions concerning an applicant, we advise that only those managers involved in the supervision of the individual have access to the report.

Under no circumstances should the information or contents of this report be shared with the applicant unless under the direct supervision of a trained psychologist. We recommend that this report be considered valid for one year.

Personality does change over periods of time as a result of life experiences, successes and failures over the course of life, and major life events and traumas. In the case of public safety candidates, the exposure to tragic, traumatic, and emotionally charged events in the line of duty, coupled with the need for a quick adaptation to a paramilitary culture predicts for an increased likelihood of adjustment difficulties and possible personality changes quicker than other professions. Moreover, because of the unique combination of skills required for each position, this report pertains to the job in question, only.

In his behalf, however, Mr. Merkau did use proper spelling and grammar on his Personal History Form. We also administered another writing sample, which included a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the candidate e2 80 99s career. On this exercise, the applicant demonstrated reasonably acceptable writing ability in terms of expressing his thoughts and ideas with the appropriate grammar and syntax. But once again, Mr. Merkau e2 80 99s materials lacked for the pertinent details. We are, nonetheless, encouraged by the candidate e2 80 99s scores on both sections of , which predicts positively for his job performance. All things considered, the candidate has the ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe Mr. Merkau demonstrates acceptable EQ by the empathy he has shown for others.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Merkau to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. The candidate claims that he first became interested in the fire service as a youngster. Mr. Merkau had a grandmother who worked at a hospital, which also helped shape his interests in medicine. While still attending Hersey High School, the applicant was able to attend classes in fire science given at a local community college. As we noted previously in  of this report, Mr. Merkau has worked hard to earn the proper certifications and credentials to perform as a firefighter/paramedic. As also noted earlier, he has a total of five years of experience in the fire service and EMS. There is a lot that we like about this individual. In particular, he is a polite and respectful person who will approach his duties and responsibilities in a serious manner. As noted above, Mr. Merkau rates either acceptably or strong on all of the dimensions related to success in the position in question. Hence, we have few, if any, questions about the candidate other than to raise the issue regarding the completeness of his paperwork and report writing. Thoroughness will be important for EMS reimbursement purposes, and we think his reports will require monitoring. Regardless, in light of our overall favorable review of this individual, we would recommend that Mr. Merkau be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Arlington Heights. \"',\n",

In light of these findings, we predict that Ms. Messer will handle any and all paperwork and reporting requirements in an acceptable fashion. There is no question that Ms. Messer is well-educated.

Specifically, the candidate was attentive to all of the details, and he wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, while utilizing the proper grammar and syntax. This positive behavior coupled with his conscientious  predicts for Mr. Montella handling the paperwork and report writing demands of the job in question well. This multi-sport individual maintained  grades throughout high school and college and had a strong showing on the above-reported tests of mental ability and thinking skills.

This individual performed well on all of the critical dimensions related to success as a police officer. Raised to respect others, and in particular, those in positions of authority, we see this person as open to feedback and constructive criticism aimed at improving his job performance. During college, Mr. Montella made a change of majors, having first considered studying environmental science. However, after taking a class in his anticipated major, he became less enamored with the field. On the other hand, he took a class in criminal justice which struck a chord with the candidate and led him to switch majors. After performing an internship with the Arlington Heights Police Department, he became even more committed to his chosen profession. Since this candidate spent several months at Arlington Heights PD allows the department the opportunity to add their observed input on top of our own assessment to make a better-informed decision on Mr. Montella e2 80 99s suitability for the job in question.

acknowledged experimentation with marijuana his sophomore year in high school Involved in a committed relationship to his wife of five years who is presently a student at Moody Financially stable and responsible; no significant debt    : Stable, positive, and relatively well-adjusted; not easily angered or frustrated Does not appear to be prone toward prolonged periods of worry or depression Large extended (blended) family with several close and trusted friends Enjoys a few social and recreational outlets which he finds enjoyable and invigorating Not much seems to bother this optimistic individual, yet he is realistic about addressing problems as they arise; tends to just roll with the punches  Unfamiliar with the essential job functions required of a police officer other than stories he has heard from family members involved in the law enforcement field. At the same time, we expect him to catch on rather quickly. An extrovert and rather expressive individual this applicant enjoys calling a bit of attention to himself with his sense of fashion. May need some reminders about the importance of conformity and mindfulness of the public e2 80 99s perception of professionalism based upon an officer e2 80 99s appearance. While his use of using all capital letters may be permissible for writing service reports at an auto dealership, this individual will need to polish his report writing skills for the purposes of professional documentation of police related manner (which should also include tempering or omitting his use of exclamation marks which he seems to be very fond of using). I    Average  (assesses cognitive abilities)    Spelling          s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Muhammad provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that contained all essential details and quite a bit of candid elaboration at times. Along this line, Mr. Muhammad intermittently typed in all capital letters oftentimes followed with several exclamation marks for apparent emphasis. While we believe he was trying to accent and highlight his thoughts and feelings, this type written communication struck us as a bit immature and overly expressive, and will never do when it comes to police reports or professional documentation. As will be the case with his manner of dress, Mr. Muhammad will need guidance in toning down his expressiveness and enthusiasm in the way he communicates verbally, non-verbally, and on paper. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated average writing ability. In these writing samples, Mr. Muhammad was able to express himself in complete sentences and utilized proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation most of the time. With the proper training, we expect this individual to be able to create more polished and professional documentation. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Muhammad to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported primarily by his vocabulary and the manner in which he was able to express his thoughts and ideas throughout his assessment, and by some of his occupational accomplishments to date.  Mr. Muhammad is the oldest of nine children in a mixed sibship. According to Mr. Muhammad, his parents divorced when he was six-years-old and he was raised primarily by his mother and grandmother. Mr. Muhammad e2 80 99s father has remained an important part of his life, and he reportedly feels that even though each parent remarried and went on to have more children that they are all e2 80 9cone big happy family, e2 80 9d which he attributed to their strong sense of Christian values and respect for each other. This candidate certainly seemed quite happy throughout his time at our offices, and there was a positive tone to just about everything he discussed. Once given an opportunity and a vote of confidence, Mr. Muhammad was off and running in order to learn and develop the requisite skills required to function as a service advisor. Even though this is the only police officer position for which he has ever applied, we genuinely anticipate that Mr. Muhammad will approach this opportunity with the same amount of diligence and enthusiasm as he has elsewhere in his life. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Muhammad to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question, as he received favorable ratings on all but one of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. Overall, we liked the balance he brings to the position in terms of his strong interpersonal and communication skills, and his solid work ethic. As we have noted in this report, Mr. Muhammad has several positive attributes and skills predictive of long-term success in the law enforcement field. However, this applicant is very e2 80 9cgreen e2 80 9d and does not yet know how to utilize these fine qualities to his advantage in performing both the enforcement and customer service aspects of the job. Once he has been properly trained and has obtained a more knowledgeable e2 80 9cfeel e2 80 9d for what he is actually doing with a badge, uniform, and weapon, we believe Mr. Muhammad has the potential to emerge as a very productive and well-liked officer over time. In light of our favorable review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Muhammad be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for The Moody Bible Institute. \"',\n",

Under no circumstances should the information or contents of this report be shared with the applicant unless under the direct supervision of a trained psychologist.

Personality does change over periods of time as a result of life experiences, successes and failures over the course of life, and major life events and traumas. In the case of public safety candidates, the exposure to tragic, traumatic, and emotionally charged events in the line of duty, coupled with the need for a quick adaptation to a paramilitary culture predicts for an increased likelihood of adjustment difficulties and possible personality changes quicker than other professions.

Coupled with his reserved demeanor and down to earth communication style, it may take a while for sworn officers and supervisors to get to know him as he does not call much attention to himself. Over time we believe this applicant will be able to fit in comfortably with his fellow officers and superiors, as he will strive to earn their respect and trust through his efforts on the job. I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. O e2 80 99Connor provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background which included most essential details but without much elaboration or explanation. In fact, most of his responses were very succinct phrases or clauses. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated average writing ability as he was able to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper syntax, punctuation, and grammar. This individual has the capacity to produce informative and useful reports and documents, yet he may need some reminders about the importance of thoroughness and professionalism in his writing style. Despite his sub-par scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above, we evaluate Mr. O e2 80 99Connor to possess at least average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his formal education and occupational accomplishments to date. Despite the death of both of his parents just before entering Marist High School, Mr. O e2 80 99Connor talked about the support he received from the brothers and teachers who helped him maintain his focus and provided support when he needed it. Graduating with a e2 80 9cB e2 80 9d average, Mr. O e2 80 99Connor wanted to work in the public safety field and tried to further his formal education on his own financially. After attending five colleges, this persevering individual eventually obtained his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in interdisciplinary studies from Governors State University in 2013. Whatever he may lack in terms of innate intellectual capacity, he will make up for in determination and diligence in his attempts to master the essential job functions required of a police officer.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. O\\'Connor to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. On his behalf, Mr. O e2 80 99Connor graduated from the Chicago Police Academy without difficulty in 2017, and there were no reported difficulties during his field training and probationary period with the CPD. However, Mr. O e2 80 99Connor e2 80 99s original intent was to serve the City as a firefighter and had applied for a firefighter position in 2014. Due to a reported problem with the processing of his application and credentials, he was finally extended an offer of employment in 2018. According to Mr. O e2 80 99Connor, his grandfather died in the line of duty as a Chicago firefighter which added preference points to his eligibility list score which was never counted. Although he enjoyed his time working the streets as a police officer, Mr. O e2 80 99Connor e2 80 99s career aspirations involve becoming an arson investigator at some point in his career. Stating that he likes to remain busy and active, the part-time position as a police officer in Tinley Park is particularly appealing to him as would be able to remain in both the law enforcement and fire service functions of public safety work. With the untimely death of both of his parents in the same year, Mr. O e2 80 99Connor has demonstrated a degree of emotional resilience, and he began assuming responsibility for himself and his actions at an early age. While he is not exactly polished in his communication style, this applicant is able to connect with most people rather quickly. In light of our review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. O\\'Connor be given an offer to work as a Part-Time Police Officer for the Village of Tinley Park, Illinois. \"',\n",

Name: Jason O\\'Donnell Position: Firefighter Intern Age: 24 Department: Fire Department Date: January 3, 2020     : Responsive to all forms of communication used for the assessment Conscientious about the testing process, followed instructions well for preparatory materials, and worked within the expressed timelines; punctual for his appointment Well-groomed and had a clean-cut personal appearance Neatly, but casually attired for his appointment at our office Seemed intimidated by the assessment process, especially during his interview In addition, he did not follow instructions well for the testing portion of the interview process, leaving before excused    : Pleasant, polite, and respectful individual Will defer to those in positions of authority On the other hand, he is very quiet and reserved by nature Difficult to engage in conversation Lacks for a sense of self-awareness; might not see himself as others see him Comes across as self-conscious Will take time to acclimate to his new surroundings and feel comfortable in the presence of his fellow firefighters    : Has a history of helping others in his roles as a lifeguard Wants to feel proud of his contribution to society High needs for variety and excitement dictate that he wants a job where he can be active Although not a very socially outgoing individual, the camaraderie of the fire service is appealing to the applicant In his own words, he is seeking a physicaly active job with something different everyday and is always evolving    : B.S. degree in kinesiology from Illinois State University awarded in 2018 Recently completed his EMT-B classes at McHenry County Community College and is awaiting the test for certification No B.O.F. certification Numerous certifications in water safety Worked as a lifeguard and pool supervisor for a couple of local health clubs    : Hardworking, conscientious candidate Rates high on our measures related to following the rules Strong track record for attendance and punctuality; states that he has only been tardy twice in four years, and similarly, he has only called off sick twice in four years Tries to set an example for his coworkers by paying attention to his job responsibilities and avoiding such distractions as looking at his cellphone and text-messaging his friends For his efforts, this person has been promoted into supervisory roles    : Raised with a healthy respect for those in positions of authority Reports never having been terminated from any previous place of work States that he has never been disciplined at work New to the fire service, it will be important that this person have a supervisor who is knowledgeable, organized, and able to act decisively This person will look to his superiors for a great deal of guidance and assistance    : Inexperienced, the applicant acknowledges that there are several aspects of the job where he is unsure how he will react For example, he mentioned the thought of delivering a baby as one area where he wonders about his composure Lacking in self-confidence in certain ways, handling emergencies and trauma will present a challenge for the candidate In his behalf, however, he gave several examples of where he intervened to enforce rules, even with older adults, at the swimming pools where he has been a lifeguard    : Raised with strict morals and family values; mother emphasized regular church attendance for the applicant and his siblings Reports never having been arrested and only has a single traffic citation on his record Furthermore, this person has never used or experimented with illegal substances Presently resides at home with his parents and an older brother Reports no serious relationship of any kind; he has never dated anyone on a long-term basis    : After considering several occupations, including physical therapy training, the candidate has settled on a career in the fire service and EMS We do not see him looking to make a change in his choice of a career Has a close group of childhood friends from Huntley, Illinois, who have served as his support network No harmful habits; rarely consumes alcohol except on special occasions s regularly as his way of staying in shape as well as reducing tension and stress Also engages in playing videogames online with his friends several times a week as another source of relaxation Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Clear goals and expectations for his performance on the job Honest and straightforward feedback, but delivered with sensitivity since the candidate is very conscientious and sincerely wants to do his best Guidance and direction on handling himself with confidence and composure during emergencies and trauma Monitoring his reports and paperwork to make sure that they are appropriately detailed and complete I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. O\\'Donnell submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate, but not especially full of detail. In his behalf, however, Mr. O\\'Donnell made the proper use of spelling and grammar on his Personal History Form. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career. The applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability in terms of employing appropriate grammar and syntax. On the other hand, Mr. O\\'Donnell did not do an especially good job of providing pertinent details. When completing paperwork for the reimbursement of emergency medical services, this might prove problematic. Careful monitoring of his report writing is strongly advised. The above-reported test results on  are encouraging and predict positively for the applicant. All things considered, this candidate has the ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. O\\'Donnell to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. Never having been through a psychological assessment before, Mr. O\\'Donnell struck us as intimidated by the process. It was difficult to engage him in conversation; thereby, making the interview portion of the assessment process harder than for most applicants for public safety positions. The applicant tried several career options before settling on the fire service and EMS. In college the candidate studied kinesiology, and gave serious thought to becoming a PT (physical therapist). However, becoming a PT requires a number of years of additional schooling, and this active and energetic individual could not envision himself sitting in a classroom any longer. We think that Mr. O\\'Donnell has made the right choice, but at age 24, he is still very much a work-in-progress. Furthermore, it will take the applicant time to adjust to his new surroundings and his fellow fire medics. In time, he will be seen as a cooperative and hardworking contributor to the department once he overcomes his initial shyness around his coworkers. Therefore, in light of our overall, favorable review, we would be comfortable in recommending that Mr. O e2 80 99Donnell be given an offer to join the program as a Firefighter Intern for the Algonquin-Lake in the Hills Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

An  student at Huntley High School, Mr. Palermo was involved in sports and he also worked part-time. In fact, this individual was awarded the sportsmanship award upon graduation.

As unusual as this may sound Mr. Palermo maintained that he has very positive relationships with both his father and step-father and admires each of them. Since turning his focus toward following in their footsteps, this candidate has worked hard to prepare himself for a career position. Mr. Palermo has reportedly very much enjoyed his brief tenure with the Libertyville FD over the past couple of months.

Although he is currently being processed for hire with the Franklin Park FD, Mr. Palermo made it clear that his preference would be to accept an offer from Libertyville because of the reported e2 80 9cpolitics e2 80 9d and instability he has learned about with the FPFD. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Palermo to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and paramedic. Overall we liked the balance this individual brings to the position in terms of his positive attitude, intelligence, and amiable interpersonal style. From all indications he is a sincere and hardworking applicant who will represent the department in a professional and conscientious manner. In light of our review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Palermo be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Libertyville, Illinois. \"',\n",

not prone to excuse-making behavior As a teenager, this person stayed out of trouble with the law While he smoked marijuana about ten times in high school, he has not used any illegal substances since 2010 Moreover, the applicant does not drink alcohol except on special occasions, and even then, his limits are well within the normal ranges of moderate consumption Both on and off the job, this person is expected to act and behave responsibly    : In light of our observations about the applicant e2 80 99s anxious temperament and lack of self-confidence, we do not think that he will fare well as a police officer at this point in his life In his behalf, the candidate is still young at 23 years of age, and he may develop greater self-assurance and find himself to be a more viable applicant for the job at a future date We are afraid that the applicant may be overwhelmed by the pressures and demands of the job itself We have already expressed doubts above about his assertiveness and composure Furthermore, attending to a radio and responding to calls will be stressful on this individual who does not seem capable of multi-tasking effectively  At this point in this person e2 80 99s life we do not think that he is capable of handling the more stressful demands of the position and question. Even with excellent training and support systems, this person is expected to feel overwhelmed by the job. I Mental Ability  Norms for Police Officers        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Palomo e2 80 99s handwriting was exceptionally neat. We administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On both of his exercises, this applicant demonstrated excellent writing ability. The candidate was especially attentive to the important details. We also observed that Mr. Palomo wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, while making the proper use of grammar and syntax. It is also worth mentioning that while the applicant admits that he is not totally fluent in Spanish, Mr. Palomo can understand and read it fairly well. In fact, Mr. Palomo stated as a highlight of his time with the Oakbrook Terrace Police Department, he assisted officers in helping a victim who only spoke Spanish and who wanted to file a complaint with the officers. Besides writing exceptionally well, Mr. Palomo performed  on the two cognitive ability measures that we administered as part of the assessment process. Specifically, the candidate exceeded the standards of acceptable performance on both the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Apprai Test and .  Mr. Palomo spent his early years living in Chicago with his older sister and younger brother. The family relocated to Bolingbrook, Illinois, when the candidate was five years old. Both parents are extremely hardworking, and this is a major value they passed on to their children along with respecting other people and valuing one e2 80 99s family members. His father is a machine operator, and his mother is an administrator. Although the applicant attended a Catholic elementary school in Bolingbrook, he enrolled at the public high school. Up until his sophomore year at Bolingbrook High School, Mr. Palomo played soccer. By the time he was a junior, however, he went right to work at a family-style restaurant in town. As we noted in  of this report, Mr. Palomo is still employed at the same Red Robin Restaurant in Bolingbrook. After graduating from high school, the applicant attended Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois. Undecided about a major by the end of his first year, the candidate eventually chose to major in criminal justice. This would lead to an internship with the Bolingbrook Police Department and later a records clerk position at the Oakbrook Terrace Police Department. Now, he is looking to become a full time, sworn police officer. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Palomo to be a less than acceptable applicant for the position in question. There is a great deal we like about this individual as stated previously in I and III of this report. Thus, it is with much regret that we render our recommendation not to hire him. There is no question that Mr. Palomo is polite and respectful. He can get along with just about anybody, and he will show consideration for his fellow officers in the department as well as the citizens of the community. On the other hand, he is an anxious and nervous person. The assessment process was upsetting for him as noticed by his moist handshake and the generally reserved way in which he expressed his thoughts and ideas. Under the pressure to perform on the street, this person will likely be overwhelmed. As such, we have difficulty seeing Mr. Palomo survive his probationary period with the Bolingbrook Police Department. On routine arrest matters we see him as showing leniency to a fault. On more serious matters, like difficult stops or domestic disputes, we think that the applicant lacks the presence to command the situation and bring it under control. Therefore, in light of our review, we would not recommend that Mr. Palomo be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Bolingbrook. \"',\n",

In this regard, applicant will need some guidance in establishing a more authoritative bearing. With experience and increased self-confidence, we believe this will gradually evolve. Can be rather hard on himself in his eagerness to please and accommodate his superiors, which may become evident in some performance anxiety during his field training. I Mental Ability  Norms for Police Officers        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Palomo provided a very thorough and detailed account of his personal and professional background which included ample details and a bit of elaboration when it was necessary. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated  writing ability, as he consistently demonstrated the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Mr. Palomo is not expected to have difficulty producing informative and professional reports and documentation as a police officer. If anything, this individual tends to be rather expansive and verbose in his writing style. As a result, he may require some reminders about the value of conciseness and focusing on essential details. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Palomo to possess average to slightly  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his grades throughout high school and college, and by the manner in which he was able to express his thoughts and ideas (orally and on paper) during his assessment. It should be noted that this individual scored in the e2 80 9c e2 80 9d range on all of the same mental ability tests he was administered during a prior assessment. We do not have a definitive explanation for the variability in his scores this time around, as he was intent and focused during his test administration. A hard worker, Mr. Palomo obtained his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice with a reported 3.70 GPA while working two jobs throughout his college years. In summation, Mr. Palomo is not expected to have difficulty mastering the essential information and skills required of a police officer.  The second of three children, Mr. Palomo was born, raised, and continues to reside in suburban Bolingbrook where he attended local public schools. A good student, Mr. Palomo stated that he gave up extracurricular activities to begin assuming financial responsibility for himself at an early age. Raised with the value of hard work and determination, Mr. Palomo has demonstrated those ideals thus far in his perseverance in bettering his qualifications and credentials for a career as a police officer. Uncertain of his vocational future upon entering college, Mr. Palomo resonated with the subject matter in his criminal justice coursework, and he took it upon himself to obtain some relevant experience by working in records at the Oakbrook Terrace PD during his college years. An optimistic, positive, and motivated applicant, this individual is expected to put his best foot forward throughout his training and education with the Wheaton Police Department. Although he recently completed a police academy and is undergoing his field training with the Elk Grove Village PD, Mr. Palomo encountered Chief Volpe in some of his classes and admired the Chief e2 80 99s direction and overview of policing in the 21st century and leadership style. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Palomo to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question, as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. This applicant has taken most of the right steps to prepare himself for a law enforcement career, and he came across as eager and enthusiastic about expanding his policing knowledge in the years ahead. Overall, we like the balance he brings to the position in terms of his agreeable interpersonal style and his solid work ethic. While he will need to e2 80 9cgrow into e2 80 9d a more confident and authoritative bearing, we do not have concerns about his suitability for police work from a psychological perspective. In light of our review, we would recommend that Mr. Palomo be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Wheaton, Illinois. \"',\n",

At the same time, he has had minimal experience enforcing rules and maintaining order other than his observational time as a law enforcement intern and some brief work as a bouncer in college. May be overly eager to impress his FTO e2 80 99s and peers of his value and capability. Comes across as serious and businesslike, which we believe is his way of projecting a command presence. Could stand to improve upon his approachability. I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Pawula provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background which contained essential details. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated average to slightly  writing ability as he consistently expressed himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. This candidate has the ability to produce professional and informative reports as a police officer. We are at a loss to explain Mr. Pawula e2 80 99s sub-par scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above as we evaluate his overall mental ability to be within the average range. This assertion is supported by his educational and occupational accomplishments to date, and by the manner in which he was able to express his thoughts and ideas (orally and on paper) during his assessment. Mr. Pawula graduated from McHenry West High School in 2013 with a reported 2.80 GPA. During his high school years, he participated in sports and also worked part-time his final two years. With the intention of becoming a police officer, Mr. Pawula went on to obtain his associate e2 80 99s degree from McHenry County College before transferring to Illinois State University where he earned his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice in 2018 with average grades. According to Mr. Pawula, he was diagnosed with an attention deficit disorder in 2015 by a neurologist who prescribed medication (Adderall) which he has been taking since that time which he feels has helped his focus and concentration considerably. We do not believe this applicant requires any type of special accommodation to perform essential job functions. Moreover, Mr. Pawula will apply himself diligently to master the essential information required for the position in question.  The youngest of three children, Mr. Pawula spent his developmental years in McHenry where he attended local public schools. According to Mr. Pawula, his parents divorced during his freshman year of high school, but has maintained positive relationships with both of them as he is now living with his father. From all indications, this applicant is a social and somewhat competitive person, who has picked up a large number of close and trusted friends over the years. His interest in police work was attributed to his neighbor who served as a McHenry police officer during his childhood and teen years. Along this line, Mr. Pawula looks forward to being in a role in which others can call on for help and assistance with just about any matter or issue. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Pawula to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. A determined and persevering individual, Mr. Pawula has taken several steps to better his qualifications for a law enforcement career by furthering his formal education in criminal justice, and completing an internship with the Urbana PD. Eager to begin his policing career, this determined and persevering individual is expected to put his best foot forward during his education and training in academy time and probationary period. While he may not be a particularly distinguished candidate considering his youth and inexperience, this candidate possesses a solid work ethic, and he should be able to forge comfortable and collaborative working relationships with his fellow officers. In light of our review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Pawula be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Schaumburg, Illinois. \"',\n",

Our sense is that his paperwork and reports will be to the point and accurate, providing his superior officers with an acceptable product. As seen above, Mr. Plote performed very well on our battery of tests. Throughout high school and college, he maintained fairly average grades but also participated in many different extracurricular activities including sports, choir, band, and foreign language club. These many interests may have spread the candidate e2 80 99s attention thin, and his reluctance to complete any on-line educational requirements could be attributable to procrastination or a lack of sustained focus. His commitment to the field appears solid, so we do not have any significant concerns about Mr. Plote following through with his obligations, he just may need some pointed reminders. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Plote to possess the necessary thinking skills to master the essential elements of the role, and to perform the duties and responsibilities of the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Plote to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. The last time that we evaluated this person for a position with the Fire Department in Hanover Park, we found him acceptable. However, the applicant was relieved of his duties with the department because he failed act in a timely fashion in terms of becoming properly accredited with the primary resource hospital used by the Hanover Park Fire Department. According to the candidate, he sent emails and called the people at Sherman Hospital in Elgin, Illinois, in order to set up a testing session in order to be accredited at the facility. However, over the course of about a month, Mr. Plote did not hear any kind of a response from the hospital. Because of his failure to complete the accreditation with Sherman Hospital, Mr. Plote was told that he would not be scheduled for any future shifts with the Hanover Park Fire Department. In retrospect, the applicant acknowledges that he could have been more assertive in following up on the status of his testing date. Interestingly enough, when he finally did test at Sherman Hospital, Mr. Plote failed the written portion of the test, but passed the practical piece. Two weeks later, he would successfully pass both parts of the accreditation process. Since the Carol Stream Fire Protection District has had experience with Mr. Plote, they should feel comfortable with him. This particular information was conveyed to us in a conversation with the department e2 80 99s current Fire Chief. Therefore, in light of our observations and assessment, we would recommend that Mr. Plote be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Carol Stream Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

stayed at most places of work for at least three years Prides himself on his punctuality; typically arrives as many as 40 minutes early for his shifts Often volunteers to take extra shifts, especially when one of his coworkers calls off Has been diligent about checking his gear and being fully prepared on the job, but notes the use of e2 80 9cTo Do e2 80 9d lists would ensure that he does not forget anything For all of his conscientious behavior on the job, he has shown signs of selective motivation when it comes to completing his on-line education requirements Also notes that he could check his email more often and join department committees    : Respects a supervisor who has done his job previously and is able to provide effective and relevant hands-on coaching and advice Having a supervisor work alongside of him has been both motivating and instructional Appreciates frank feedback on his performance Wants to know when he has made mistakes along with learning helpful steps for preventing any reoccurrences of his mistakes;

Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Plote to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. Although he might not represent a typical entry-level applicant for the fire service, Mr. Plote is open and honest about his past. Raised with very traditional values, Mr. Plote grew up on a family farm near Malta, Illinois. We suspect that the candidate e2 80 99s initial career interests tended toward his family business in agriculture. However, encouraged by a school friend, he started giving serious thought to the fire service by the time he was a senior in high school in DeKalb. Not only was he an accomplished athlete at DeKalb High School, playing football, baseball, and wrestling, but Mr. Plote also played trumpet in the school band. As noted above, he stayed local in Kishwaukee County and earned the majority of his credentials to become a firefighter/paramedic. We believe that he will be a valuable addition to the department. On the other hand, if he continues to procrastinate in completing his educational requirements, it could have an adverse impact on his ability to progress in a career in the fire service and emergency medicine. With some good guidance and encouragement, Mr. Plote should perform well, and both the department and the community will enjoy his presence. In light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Plote be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Hanover Park. \"',\n",

We also administered another writing sample, which included a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career. On this exercise, this applicant demonstrated reasonably acceptable writing ability in terms of using appropriate grammar and syntax. However, once again, Mr. Ralston failed to provide pertinent details, which means that his paperwork and report writing might require careful monitoring during the early stages of his employment on the job. The above-reported scores on  are encouraging, and all things considered, the candidate has the ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. In light of our previous  about the candidate in  of this report, we believe that Mr. Ralston possesses good EQ as he is empathetic and compassionate when it comes to patient care.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Ralston to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. According to the candidate, he gave serious thought to a career in law enforcement. Toward that end, he took classes in community college in criminal justice and performed a few ride-alongs. However, after taking entry-level fire science classes at the same institution, Harper College, the candidate switched his major to fire science. As stated above, he has taken all the proper steps to gain the required certifications and licenses to become a firefighter/paramedic. As with many applicants who aspire to the fire service and EMS, Mr. Ralston began his career working on a private ambulance. At present he is completing this third year with the Hanover Park Fire Department in a part-time capacity. Clearly, there is a lot to like about this serious-minded and conscientious candidate. Mr. Ralston is a respectful and considerate candidate who will make a concerted effort to get along well with his fellow firefighter/paramedics. We especially like his positive outlook and accompanying optimistic attitude. These are qualities that will contribute to good morale in the department. Although the applicant is only 24 years of age, he is a mature and responsible individual. From an early age, he realized that some kind of public safety career would be an appropriate choice for him. Toward that end, he has acted maturely and avoided serious trouble which might have disqualified the candidate from consideration for a career in the fire service and EMS. Therefore, in light of our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Ralston be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the City of DeKalb. \"',\n",

thus, we strongly recommend continued drilling and training to help him continue to improve his firefighting and medical skills I Mental Ability  Norms for Firefighters          s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, they were accurate and complete. While paperwork and report writing will probably not be high on Mr. Ralston e2 80 99s list of favorite activities, this conscientious candidate will make an effort to produce a high-quality, finished product. When it comes to billing for EMS services, Mr. Ralston will pay attention to the details. An inspection of the above-reported test results reveals that he scored far better on  than he did on the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Apprai Test. Occasionally low scores on the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Apprai Test can be explained by a discomfort worth uncertainty and ambiguity. In the case of this candidate, as we noted in  of our report, he possesses high needs for clarity. As such, we are not surprised by his depressed performance on the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Apprai Test. Regardless, we evaluate Mr. Ralston to possess an acceptable amount of mental ability as it pertains to mastering the essential elements of the position in question.  Mr. Ralston was raised in northwest suburban Schaumburg, Illinois. The applicant has a twin sister and a younger brother. His father has spent 30 years in the same job with an auto body shop. His mother performs secretarial work. Both parents stressed a number of solid values that focused on dedication, loyalty, and hard work. At present Mr. Ralston still resides at home with his parents and his 100-year old grandmother. Mr. Ralston has also been involved with a young woman for the past four and a half years. Earlier in our report we spoke of Mr. Ralston e2 80 99s interest in a public safety position. According to the candidate, he gave serious thought to a career in law enforcement. Toward that end, he took classes in community college in criminal justice and performed a few fide-alongs. However, after taking entry-level fire science classes at the same institution, Harper College, the candidate switched his major to fire science. As a result, the applicant is looking to be awarded his degree in fire science from Harper College this year, in 2017. In conjunction with his degree program at community college, the applicant has ridden along with the Schaumburg Fire Department to get a better feel for the job. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Ralston to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. There is a lot to like about this serious-minded and conscientious candidate. Mr. Ralston is a respectful and considerate candidate who will make a concerted effort to get along well with his fellow firefighter/paramedics. We especially like his positive outlook and accompanying optimistic attitude. These are qualities that will contribute to good morale in the department. Although the applicant is only 22 years of age, he is a mature and responsible individual. From an early age, he realized that some kind of public safety career would be an appropriate choice for him. Toward that end, he acted maturely and avoided serious trouble as well as stayed away from using any kind of illegal substances. Moreover, he has taken the proper steps to prepare himself for a career in the fire service and emergency medicine by earning the proper credentials and also obtaining valuable, practical, hands-on experience as an EMT-B with a private ambulance service. Of course, he still has a lot to learn. Nevertheless, in light of our review, we would recommend that Mr. Ralston be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Hanover Park. \"',\n",

For example, his time with Domino e2 80 99s Pizza was left off the form. In his favor, however, Mr. Redd did pay attention to using the proper spelling and grammar. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career. The applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability, but the level of sufficient detail and information was lacking. On the other hand, he used appropriate grammar and syntax. In light of this observation, Mr. Redd might need reminding to take his time and be accurate in filling out paperwork and EMS reports. With respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate will demonstrate generally solid emotional intelligence. All things considered, the candidate has the ability to learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Redd to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. The candidate claims that working in the fire service was something that he has always considered, but he did not act on it in terms of getting the right credentials and experience until recently. For most of his adult life, Mr. Redd worked for pizza restaurants. As recently as May of this year, he was employed at Jet e2 80 99s Pizza, where he served as an assistant manager, supervising seven employees. It was in 2018, a couple of years after he started working at Jet e2 80 99s Pizza, that Mr. Redd enrolled in an EMT training class at Harper College in Palatine Illinois. This year, he elected to earn his B.O.F. from a fire academy in Romeoville, Illinois. Since July of last year, 2018, the applicant has accepted a part-time position with Superior Ambulance. While the depth of his experience has not been deep, it has given this individual sufficient exposure to the fire service and EMS. Wanting to help others and seeking a career that will keep him active and engaged, Mr. Redd is excited about continuing his career in his chosen profession. There is a lot that we like about this promising person, who appears to have the potential to be an effective fire medic. Possessing a strong work ethic and desire to serve the public, he is appropriately mature and has experience operating with a strict chain of command. While he continues to need further exposure to the fire service and EMS, we think that he is on his way toward accomplishing his goal of becoming a firefighter/paramedic. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Redd be given an offer to work as a part-time Firefighter for the Countryside Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

Name: James Reece Position: Police Officer Age: 31 Department: Police Department Date: September 17, 2019     : Tall, athletically-built individual Clean-cut candidate with closely cropped hair Professionally attired in a suit and tie for his appointment at our office Projects a credible police presence Friendly manner will also allow the applicant to appear approachable in the eyes of the public    : Personable disposition;

he has been with the agency since January of 2016 Successfully completed the training academy through PTI prior to returning to the Hampshire Police Department Prior to becoming a sworn police officer, the applicant was employed from 2011 to 2015 in private security at the Grand Victoria Casino This person does not have a formal college degree in criminal justice    : Having earned the right to be the OIC (officer-in-charge) at the Hampshire Police Department speaks to the applicant e2 80 99s leadership skills on the job According to the candidate, he was awarded the distinction of Officer of the Year at the Hampshire Police Department in 2017 On the other hand, the candidate can be guilty of careless errors For example, he has been disciplined for minor mistakes, such as failing to record his name on the payroll sheet In addition, this person was facetiously awarded for his tendency to have more minor accidents with his squad car than the other officers at the Hampshire Police Department    : Possesses a healthy respect for those in positions of authority Spoke well of his superiors at the Hampshire Police Department Prefers a fair degree of freedom and autonomy; he wants to feel free to perform his job At the same time, the applicant is appreciative of superior officers who back his actions  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : The candidate claims that in his position as a police officer with the Hampshire Police Department he encounters a relatively low call volume Nonetheless, the applicant is active with traffic enforcement Also, he intervenes effectively in domestic disputes which occur about once a month in the community Once again, however, his tendency to be lax resulted in a disciplinary action when he missed a gun during a pat-down of a suspect in April of 2018    : The oldest of three children and raised with a healthy set of moral values, including hard work and showing respect for other people Reports a single arrest on his record in 2009, which was a DUI after a car accident in Bloomington, Illinois, where the candidate was cited for the illegal use of marijuana The applicant admits to using marijuana between 25 and 50 times, but his last usage of the illegal substance was in 2009, prior to his career in law enforcement To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he took full responsibility for all of his mistakes and showed the proper regret    : For almost four years, he has been serving in the capacity of a sworn police officer with the Hampshire Police Department, and he shows no signs of stress resulting from his job Although the applicant is living at home, he is engaged to a woman he met through his work with the Hampshire Police Department; she is a dispatch operator From all indications, this individual has a good support network of family and friends Reports drinking alcohol at least twice a week, and on special occasions, such as weddings, he has been known to consume six or more drinks While not inclined to drink heavily most of the time, exceeding six drinks borders on the definition of binge drinking  Monitoring his driving habits in the police cruiser as he seems prone to minor fender-bender type accidents Caution about his confident attitude adding to the perception that he is cocky and sees himself as better than other officers in the department Reminders to pay attention to the smaller details, which on occasion has resulted in receiving a minor disciplinary action A word or two to this individual about his tendency to consume alcohol on certain occasions in excess of six drinks, which is the lower limit of what is considered binge drinking I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Reece took his time to provide accurate information on his Personal History Form. On the other hand, the level of detail given on this document, while sufficient was rather limited. We also administered two other writing samples, which were typewritten. On both of his exercises, this applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability, which is not surprising given his strong showing on the  section of . In his favor, the candidate was attentive to most of the important details on his written exercises, which included a mock police report as well as a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of his career in law enforcement. Moreover, Mr. Reece wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, and he used proper grammar and syntax. Even though he does occasionally miss some of the details, we have no reason to believe that his paperwork and report writing will be substandard considering his performance on the writing exercises which were part of the assessment process. Mr. Reece is presently performing as a police officer and demonstrating the proper thinking skills to handle the mental demands of the job in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Reece to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. At present, this person is performing in the role of a sworn police officer, albeit with a smaller agency in Hampshire, Illinois. The candidate successfully passed his probationary period with the department, and prior to that completed the training academy sponsored by PTI in downstate Illinois. In 2017, Mr. Reece was recognized as the Officer of the Year by the Hampshire Police Department. On the other hand, he has been disciplined for minor infractions from accidents with his police cruiser to missing certain details. With his sense of humor and confident attitude, certain individuals at his new place of work might see him as cocky or even flippant. In these instances, these issues will need to be addressed to prevent any reoccurrence. The candidate does seem open to constructive feedback and willing to apply what he learns from the experience. Regardless, we like this individual e2 80 99s attitude toward his job and the need to protect the citizens of the community. We envision Mr. Reece as a reliable back-up officer, and we do not view him as a potential officer safety hazard in his attempts to keep order. Although the applicant has a few areas that represent opportunities for development as listed previously in this report, we see him as a viable candidate for the job. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Reece be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Batavia. \"',\n",

Name: Christopher Reese Position: Police Officer Age: 32 Department: Police Department Date: June 19, 2018     : Clean-cut and dressed in a business suit; professional and cordial presentation Confident, straightforward, and respectful in his presentation Open and straightforward in discussing matters in his personal and professional life Came across as engaging, mature, and candid After three years on the job as a police officer, this individual knows how to project a command presence; most will view him as fairly approachable as well    : Outgoing, generally agreeable, and positive in his interpersonal style High needs for inclusion and acceptance from others but will not compromise morals or values in order to fit in Polite and considerate in his interactions with others Tends to be more task-focused than he is relationship-oriented Nevertheless, he has the capacity to forge strong bonds and working relationships with his peers    : Rates high on our measures of altruism Feels good about himself when he is able to make a positive impact on the lives of others Dating back to his Eagle Scout project of restoring prairie land, nearly all of this applicant e2 80 99s jobs have involved community service work of one type or another Also drawn to the variety, activity, and mental and physical challenges involved in a law enforcement career Will be respectful and professional in his interactions with citizens  relevant work and life experience  : Bachelor e2 80 99s degree in biology and education from North Park University in 2010 Completed his student teaching and earned a teaching certificate that same year Worked as a lifeguard manager from 2005 to 2014 (seasonally) for the Mount Prospect Park District During and after his college years this individual worked in a warehouse which provided an array of Christian products for about five and one-half years Hired as a police officer in Island Lake in March of 2015 Certified as a field training officer and evidence technician    : Determined, energetic, and persistent in his basic work habits Consistently employed in some capacity since his high school years Rates high on our measures of conscientiousness Serious about his duties and responsibilities Go-getter who will initiate his own activity; led the Island Lake PD in DUI arrests for the past two years Will strive to meet or exceed departmental performance standards    : Positive relationships with most of the authority figures in his life up until recently In that regard, he appears to have rubbed his administrative sergeant and Chief the wrong way which he attributes to his desire to make a lateral transfer to another department Remarkably, this individual maintained that he has never been the recipient of any type of disciplinary action Follows the rules; will adhere to departmental policies and procedures (perhaps in a rather rigid manner) Not very open-minded; some concerns about his receptivity to corrective feedback and criticism Will be respectful and accommodating in his interactions with his superiors  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Confident, straightforward, and assertive Carries himself in a poised and professional manner Very good communication skills; articulate and well-spoken At the same time this candidate may come across as rather businesslike, abrupt, and serious; not much warmth or humor Will hold the line when his authority is challenged May be a bit heavy handed in his enforcement activities    : Reasonably open and candid in reporting some of the regrets and disappointments he has had in his life thus far Able to acknowledge his own contribution to problems and setbacks when they occurred, but did so with a bit of trepidation Acknowledged using marijuana e2 80 9cabout 100 times e2 80 9d in his life with the last time being in 2005-2006 long before his decision to become a police officer No brushes with law enforcement Married for the past three and one-half years and owns his own home; financially responsible    : Stable, level-headed, and relatively well-adjusted Not prone toward prolonged periods of worry or depression Tends to be action-oriented in the face of adversity and obstacles Supportive base of family and several close friends Enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking, hunting, and camping in order to relax and blow off steam when necessary  Active and aggressive officer who likes to stay busy and productive. At the same time, we believe he has the capacity to adapt to a more community-oriented and customer service approach to police work. Amiable and engaging, this individual may come across as a bit officious at times. Yet he appears to have established solid working relationships with his fellow officers and coworkers over the years. I    Average  (assesses cognitive abilities)    Spelling          s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Reese provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that included essential details and a degree of elaboration when it was necessary. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this applicant demonstrated excellent writing ability, as he was able to express himself in complete and coherent sentences which contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Mr. Reese has the capacity to produce professional and informative reports and documentation as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Reese to possess  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his academic and occupational accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above. An outstanding student at Prospect High School, Mr. Reese was involved in all bands and earned his Eagle Scout Merit Badge while graduating with a reported 4.50 (5.00 scale) in 2004. Although he had some interest in police work, Mr. Reese was also very interested in biology and set off to Augustana College as a biology major. He spent two and one-half years there until he was disappointingly suspended for having alcohol on the college e2 80 99s premises. This incident caused him to eventually transfer to North Park University where he did obtain his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in biology and education, and earned his teaching certification as well in 2009 and 2010, respectively. All things considered, this bright and capable applicant has already demonstrated his ability to master the essential functions required of a police officer given his experience and training thus far in his career.  The youngest of three children, Mr. Reese spent his developmental years in Mount Prospect where he attended local public schools. With his father being a physician and his mother a retired teacher, this applicant was raised with the value and importance of community service work, which he began doing while he was in high school. Although there have some bumps in the road for this individual in terms of his suspension from college for alcohol possession and his use of marijuana up until 2005, Mr. Reese appears to have matured considerably since that time, and he is now an established police officer, married, and the proud father of a one-year-old son. After what appears to have been a fairly successful and productive tenure as an officer in Island Lake, Mr. Reese is seeking to affiliate with a much more hospitable organization. In this regard, Mr. Reese stated that when he announced that he was testing elsewhere, his administrative sergeant and Chief resurrected felony charges against him for a situation that occurred about two years ago that he has already reported to the Lindenhurst PD. According to Mr. Reese during his interview, the State e2 80 99s Attorney threw the charge out, yet he feels a bit resentful about the manner in which he has been treated by the command staff with the ILPD, especially in light of his effectiveness on the streets. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Reese to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question, as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. This individual seems to have taken to the job rather quickly since making a rather dramatic career change in his life a couple of years ago. A persistent, hardworking, and assertive individual, Mr. Reese is expected to be an aggressive officer, but also has the capacity to perform the customer service aspects of the job in an adept and professional manner. In fact, with his teaching qualifications, some of those skills may prove to be beneficial as a trainer or perhaps instructor with his fellow officers and with citizen groups. Although he has made some mistakes in his life, our assessment indicates that he has matured considerably over the past several years since his college days and shortly thereafter. In summation, we believe he will represent the department in a positive and favorable manner. In light of our review, we would recommend that Mr. Reese be extended an offer of employment to serve as a Police Officer for the Village of Lindenhurst, Illinois. \"',\n",

Name: Cory Richards Position: Firefighter Age: 27 Department: Fire Department Date: January 23, 2020   y  : Communicates with a loud, booming voice that could be heard all the way down the halls of our office Energetic and talkative individual Comes across as self-confident to a fault We sense that both his high rate of talking along with his booming voice are driven in part by his anxious temperament Even though the candidate claims to appreciate the degree of teamwork and camaraderie associated with life in the fire service and EMS, he is likely to be competitive with his peers States that many of his peers e2 80 9cwant to be just like him e2 80 9d and are envious of his track record for promotion; possesses a high opinion of himself Finally, despite his enjoyment of the camaraderie in the fire service, he is not interested in socializing with his fellow firefighters after work hours We question whether he can forge comfortable and genuine relationships with his peers  AND PERSONA   : Believes that the fire service and EMS are a e2 80 9ccalling for him e2 80 9d from a higher power Scored  on our measures of altruism Seemed genuine and sincere in his desire to serve, protect, and assist others in need Also drawn to the variety, activity, and mental and physical challenges involved in a career in the fire service and EMS For example, he rates  on our measures of excitement-seeking As noted above, the candidate has also found the camaraderie associated with being a firefighter/paramedic as satisfying     : Spent five years in the U.S. Navy from 2012 to 2017 as a medical corpsman Earned his EMT-B initially at Brookhaven College in Dallas, Texas Earned his paramedic e2 80 99s license from Swedish American Hospital in Rockford Awarded his B.O.F. certification in 2019 from Rock Valley College Since the fall of 2017, he has been employed with the A-tec Ambulance Company Joined the North Park Fire Protection District in October of last year Possesses relevant work and life experience; however, the applicant demonstrates some characteristics of emotional immaturity Might not always hold himself accountable for his actions and decisions in his personal and professional life He is prone to making excuses to justify his behavior Moreover, his test results indicated that he responded in a highly self-protective fashion In his favor, this person has experienced no brushes with law enforcement     : Has demonstrated good job stability with five years in the Navy and another three years with the A-tec Ambulance Company Rates  on our measures of conscientiousness, which was not entirely reflected in the materials he submitted as part of his assessment Prides himself on his efficiency and time management; yet, the applicant acknowledges being tardy between five and six times a year Track record for job stability indicates this person has generally enjoyed positive relationships with most of the authority figures in his life In his favor, he reports never having been terminated from any previous place of employment On the other hand, he was disciplined at the A-tec Ambulance Company for speeding at 85 m.p.h. even though he was not responding to an emergency call According to the candidate, however, he felt it was an emergency and pushed back against his superiors We suspect that he might not be entirely open-minded and receptive to new ideas and constructive criticism  ability to cope with stress, remain composed, be assertive  : Able to control emotional expression and curb frustrations; reasonably professionally mature Applicant has been able to adaptively cope with some of the more stressful and gruesome aspects of life in the fire service and EMS work thus far The candidate claims that he feels a sense of guilt for not reacting more adversely to the trauma that he has witnessed; states that he detaches his feelings While the detached feelings are helpful for processing the stress and emotions of the moment, we do have questions about how this impacts his bedside manner in dealing with patients in terms of empathy, compassion, and the ability to convey reassurance Small but supportive base of family and a couple of close friends Possesses no potentially harmful habits that would impair his performance on the job For example, he appears to consume alcohol in relative moderation when off work Committed to the fire service and unlikely to leave for another line of work  Caution about coming across as loud and boorish in the close confines of the firehouse Additional caution about being perceived as overly confident, especially in the presence of his more experienced peers in the firehouse Monitoring of his paperwork and report writing, since he tends to make careless mistakes I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Richards submitted a Personal History Form that was not entirely accurate and contained some notable errors and mistakes. In addition, Mr. Richards did not do an especially good job of offering sufficient information and detail. We also administered another writing sample which included a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the applicant e2 80 99s career. Once again, on this exercise, the applicant failed to demonstrate acceptable writing ability. In particular, he failed to provide pertinent details. While completing paperwork and report writing are not major parts of the job, a failure to provide accurate and detailed information can have negative implications. The fact that Mr. Richards performed extremely well on the verbal portion of  shows that the applicant has the aptitude to do paperwork, but we suspect that it is seen as boring and routine in his eyes. In short, Mr. Richards will be guilty of showing selective motivation for certain parts of his job. Regardless, all things considered, the candidate has the ability to master the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Richards to be a generally acceptable applicant for the position in question, but we have raised a couple of concerns that bear noting. For example, the candidate strikes us as a person with a somewhat inflated opinion of himself. On the other hand, his bravado could be masking underlying doubts and insecurities. Regardless, we suspect that he will experience difficulty fitting in with his fellow firefighters who might view him as loud and cocky in terms of his attitude. For new hires into any department, this is a combination which can be a recipe for problems. Furthermore, we are concerned about the candidate e2 80 99s tendency to defend his actions by seeking to rationalize his behavior. This inability to hear feedback can be problematic. Finally, we detected selective motivation in terms of his willingness to devote the time and attention required to produce accurate paperwork and reports. This could become problematic because obtaining reimbursement for EMS activities depend on completing paperwork properly. In his defense, Mr. Richards has prepared himself properly for a career in the fire service and EMS. We also like his track record for employment stability as he tends to stick with what he starts. Furthermore, he has demonstrated that he can perform under pressure and stress. While he will likely be a work-in-progress, with appropriate guidance, mentorship, and increased experience under his belt, he has the potential to develop into a career firefighter. Therefore, in light of our review, we would not be opposed to recommending that Mr. Richards be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Hanover Park. \"',\n",

According to Mr. Roberts, he did not experience much of this other than some playful e2 80 9cchop-busting e2 80 9d during his internship with the BPD. We anticipate that over time, this stable and focused young man will establish his own secure identity within the department, and he will not be particularly bothered by teasing or jokes from coworkers. I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Roberts provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that was clear and thorough. We also administered two other writing samples to Mr. Roberts in which he demonstrated the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Once properly trained, this individual is not expected to have difficulty producing professional reports and documentation as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Roberts to possess  mental ability despite his deflated score on the quantitative portion of our cognitive abilities test cited above. This assertion is supported by his academic and occupational accomplishments to date, and by the manner in which he was able to express his thoughts and ideas (orally and on paper) during his assessment. Mr. Roberts graduated from South Elgin High School in 2015 with average grades, but he also demonstrated some leadership ability in that he was named captain of the track team, voted president of the aviation club, and student council vice-president. With the intention of following in his father e2 80 99s footsteps in the law enforcement field, Mr. Roberts went on to earn his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in sociology with an emphasis in criminology from Northern Illinois University in 2019. Moreover, he did so by also working part-time and graduating with a reported 3.00 GPA. All things considered, this bright and determined individual has the ability to master the essential information and skills required to become a police officer. We were especially impressed with his emotional and social intelligence.  The second of three children, Mr. Roberts spent his developmental years in nearby Bartlett where he attended local public schools. According to Mr. Roberts, he has wanted to follow in his father e2 80 99s footsteps in the field of police work, and he talked about his respect and admiration for his father e2 80 99s many friends and coworkers he has known since childhood also working in the field. From all indications, this applicant has high needs for achievement, and he possesses the drive and determination to obtain most of the goals he sets for himself. Moreover, Mr. Roberts struck us as a rather well-liked individual who should prove to be rather popular with his peers and coworkers over time due to his amiable and considerate interpersonal style, and his genuine concern for the well-being of those around him. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Roberts to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer long-term. During his interview, Mr. Roberts talked about the pride and enthusiasm he experienced during his internship with the Bloomingdale PD where he has known many of the more senior officers through his father e2 80 99s role with the department for many years. As he stated, e2 80 9cthis is my dream job, e2 80 9d and we believe he will do everything possible to follow in the fine example of his role models over the years, and he will serve the citizens of Bloomingdale with dedication and commitment. Our assessment indicates that he will be equally motivated to perform both the enforcement and community service aspects of the job. In light of our positive review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Roberts be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Bloomingdale, Illinois. \"',\n",

I    Average  (assesses cognitive abilities)    Spelling          s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Roman provided a thorough and detailed account of his personal and professional background. With the additional written exercises he was provided, this bright individual was able to effectively express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, punctuation, and syntax. Mr. Roman tends to be concise and clear in his writing style, and we anticipate that his report writing will be professional and informative. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Roman to possess  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his academic accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above. An outstanding student in high school at South Elgin, Mr. Roman graduated with a reported 4.30 GPA (4.00 scale) and was destined to study architecture in order to become part of his extended family e2 80 99s business in that field. Although he started off in that direction, Mr. Roman labeled it the most difficult decision of his life to turn down full scholarships and a guaranteed job upon graduation in order change his career focus to the fire service. Upon doing so, Mr. Roman went on to receive his associate e2 80 99s degree in fire science from Elgin Community College in 2014. All things considered, this bright and hardworking individual is not expected to have difficulty obtaining advanced fire service certifications.  The elder of two children, Mr. Roman spent his developmental years in South Elgin where attended local public schools. As mentioned above, Mr. Roman graduated with honors from SEHS by taking advanced placement classes and excelling in the classroom. According to Mr. Roman, his mother e2 80 99s family owns an established architectural firm, and he grew up feeling that it was incumbent on him to further his formal education in architecture, join the family business, and live happily ever after. Not particularly thrilled or enthused about his architecture coursework, Mr. Roman stated that around this time, his beloved grandmother encountered a serious medical emergency, and he was so impressed by the efforts and competence of the responding fire-medics that he changed his mind about his career trajectory right then and there. As might be expected, this was met with some resistance and objection on the part of his parents as he reportedly e2 80 9ccast away a full scholarship and a stable and lucrative career e2 80 9d as an architect. On his behalf, this mature and driven young man has applied himself diligently in bettering his qualifications to earn a career position with an active and reputable fire department. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Roman to be a strong candidate for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic long-term. A sincere and determined individual, Mr. Roman presented himself as a bright, mature, and committed individual, who came across with a great deal of passion and enthusiasm for the fire service. This individual has rather high needs for achievement and competence, and he looks forward to the opportunities to grow and develop personally and professionally with the Palatine Fire Department if given the chance. With continued training and experience we expect this focused and determined applicant to emerge as an asset to the department and to the community over time. In light of our very positive review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Roman be extended an offer of employment to serve as a Firefighter with the Palatine Fire Department. \"',\n",

Name: Kyle Rudauskas Position: Police Officer Age: 23 Department: Police Department Date: January 24, 2020   y  : Speaks softly, but is articulate with his words Not very easy to engage in conversation Polite and respectful towards others, but socially awkward Comes across as self-conscious Appears to lack self-confidence due in large part to his shy and highly introverted disposition Tolerant of other people and their views; will be reluctant to voice his own beliefs and opinions Rates high on our measures of agreeableness; but is likely to struggle to forge comfortable working relationships with his fellow officers Very obliging and considerate; some individuals might take advantage of his difficulty setting limits in terms of helping his coworkers In sum, it will take this person a significant amount of time in order to acclimate to his new surroundings and feel comfortable in the presence of his peers  AND PERSONA   : Unlikely to convey a credible and authoritative police presence on  due in large part to his youthful appearance and unassertive disposition On the other hand, he will be viewed as an approachable officer Scored  on our measures of altruism Seems genuine and sincere in his desire to serve, protect, and assist others in need Social service background; will be polite and courteous in his interactions with citizens While not possessing an excitement-seeking personality, he does look forward to the variety associated with this line of work In short, he does not want to sit behind a desk all day long     : B.A. degree, earned in May of 2018, in criminology and sociology from Dominican University Did not perform any kind of an internship in connection with his undergraduate program Moreover, he has never performed private security or loss prevention Spent eight months at a social service agency as an adult protective services caseworker Currently employed as a teacher e2 80 99s assistant in a school for students with special needs, the Soaring Eagle Academy Came across as open and honest in discussing some of the regrets and disappointments he has had in his life thus far Introspective and realistic individual who was able to evaluate his limitations in an objective manner Expected to honor his commitments and obligations Holds himself accountable for his actions and decisions in his personal and professional life No brushes with law enforcement We believe he fully understands the imperative that being a public servant requires him to be alert, attentive, and focused without the residual effects of any type of substance (legal or illegal)     : Will strive to meet or exceed departmental performance standards Rates high on our measures of conscientiousness; serious about his duties and responsibilities Prides himself on his efficiency and time management; all of his testing materials and documentation were clear and organized Relatively high needs for achievement; will strive to earn the respect and trust of his superiors through his efforts on the job Has had positive relationships with most of the authority figures in his life Applicant has followed the rules throughout most of his life Reports never having been terminated at any previous place of work Moreover, he states that he has never been disciplined on the job Open-minded and receptive to constructive criticism; realizes he has a lot to learn about police work Might not enjoy the discipline and rigor of life within a paramilitary organization  ability to cope with stress, remain composed, be assertive  : Major area of concern for this candidate Has relatively little, if any, experience in enforcing rules and regulations with adults In his behalf, the candidate currently has to restrain aggressive youngsters in his current capacity as a teacher e2 80 99s assistant in a school for students with special needs Admits that he is shy and tentative in dealing with strangers He expressed serious reservations about having to perform in any kind of a public speaking role Likely to be prone toward prolonged periods of worry or self-doubt Not expected to roll with the punches when faced with adversity and frustration Will be unlikely to cope with the negativity and resistance encountered on the streets in an adaptive manner In his behalf, he has a small but supportive base of family and a couple of close friends Additionally, this person possesses no potentially harmful habits that would impair his performance on the job; consumes alcohol in moderation Tries to exercise on a fairly regular basis for his health and stress relief  This candidate e2 80 99s shortcomings are inherent to his personality and cannot be easily mitigated by training If he is serious about a possible career in law enforcement, it would serve him well to seek a job as an auxiliary officer in a police agency where he could work on his assertiveness, gain some self-confidence, and experience the discipline and rigor of a paramilitary organization I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Rudauskas submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate, and it contained sufficient information and detail. Moreover, Mr. Rudauskas used proper spelling and grammar on his Personal History Form. We also administered two other writing samples, which included a mock police report as well as a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career. On both of these exercises, this applicant demonstrated reasonably acceptable writing ability by employing the appropriate grammar and syntax, but not always providing the proper level of pertinent details. A review of his performance on both sections of  is encouraging, and it predicts positively for the applicant e2 80 99s ability to learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate exhibits emotional intelligence as evidenced by his empathetic and compassionate personality, and his strong social service background.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Rudauskas to be an unacceptable applicant for the position in question. Unlike many candidates rejected for law enforcement roles, Mr. Rudauskas is not a person who will abuse his power and authority. To the contrary, he will struggle to assert himself in a position of authority. Tentative and plagued by admitted periods of self-doubt, Mr. Rudauskas strikes us as a poor fit for a career in law enforcement. His background is primarily in the field of social services, which strikes us as a much better match for his aptitudes and abilities. According to the candidate, he originally went to college to study criminology and sociology. Once Mr. Rudauskas began taking courses, he shifted his interests towards the social services. However, after having worked in a couple of positions in the social services, he has become disillusioned about the profession, and now, he is seeking to examine his options in a field related to criminology, namely law enforcement. Because Mr. Rudauskas is quite bright, as shown in I of this report, he has probably managed to place high on entry-level police examinations. Nevertheless, book-smarts are not enough to qualify this person for becoming a sworn, municipal police officer. If this individual is truly serious about a career in law enforcement, he would benefit from experience he could gain serving in an auxiliary role, such as a community service officer. This type of role would allow him some time to work on his assertiveness and self-confidence e2 80 93 two deficits highlighted in this report. Thus, in light of our many stated concerns and reservations, we would not recommend that Mr. Rudauskas be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Schaumburg. \"',\n",

Name: Kenneth Ruff Position: Police Officer Age: 35 Department: Police Department Date: March 8, 2019     : Clean-cut, well-groomed personal appearance Neatly attired for his appointment at our office, wearing a dress shirt and tie Experienced police officer, who comes across as confident and self-assured Will project a credible police presence While not overly friendly and outgoing, he will, nonetheless, be perceived as acceptably approachable by the members of the public    : Straightforward and direct in his dealings with his peers Despite being exposed to horrific situations, he remains a reasonably positive person As such, he will not be prone to complaining nor be susceptible to disgruntled officers in the department With  needs for control, the applicant admits that he often does most of the talking in a conversation with another person Regardless, we observed him to demonstrate acceptable listening skills Possesses  needs for recognition; will seek the praise and appreciation of his peers    : Prefers a job where he can stay active and interact with a wide range of people Has found it rewarding being able to assist those in need of help and assistance Enjoys being able to bond with his fellow police officers over serving the greater good His military service and job with Chicago PD not only reflect his commitment to public service, but also have motivated him by satisfying his needs for excitement The stable nature of police work in terms of the field e2 80 99s financial security has its appeal to the applicant  relevant work and life experience  : Has been serving as a police officer on the street with the Chicago Police Department since November of 2014 Also in 2014 completed the police training academy offered through CPD Assigned to the 9th District with the Chicago Police Department, where he patrols several high-crime areas Has served in the U.S. Army, primarily in war zones in Afghanistan where he worked as a senior interrogator Most of his military experience has centered on intelligence gathering activities    : Takes his duties and responsibilities seriously With  needs for variety and excitement, he might show some selective motivation in terms of seeking more interesting assignments within the department Rates relatively high on our measures of conscientiousness Not especially ambitious about moving high up in rank within the department, but we do anticipate that he will apply for a supervisory role once he is eligible For example, upon his honorable discharge from the U.S. Army in April of 2012, he held the rank of sergeant or E-5    : Has worked well with military and paramilitary settings Reports no terminations or disciplinary actions against him at any past or present place of work While he resists being micromanaged and prizes his freedom and autonomy, he does appreciate a supervisor who is able to answer his questions and provide assistance when needed Because of his past experience with the Chicago PD, the applicant appreciates working for superiors who are neither cynical nor jaded  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Exposure to criminal acts and dangerous situations with the Chicago Police Department will unlikely be replicated working for a suburban law enforcement agency Most of his traffic stops have involved stopping e2 80 9cstreet racers e2 80 9d who literally terrorize the streets of the offenders e2 80 99 neighborhoods According to the candidate, he handles at least two domestic disputes per shift This individual approaches dangerous situations with both calm and caution We believe he will be able to apply his lessons of experience going forward in his career    : Older than most entry-level candidates at age 35, this person has already served his country and been employed by a large municipal police agency Married with two children, ages three and six-months Currently resides in the City of Chicago due to departmental residency requirements Although the applicant has a sizeable mortgage of around $300,000, car loans, and minimal student debt, he has managed his financial affairs in a responsible fashion We anticipate the applicant will hold himself accountable for his actions and not seek to make excuses for his mistakes    : Not leaving CPD due to the pressure or stress of the job, although he has witnessed horrific crimes during his time there In his behalf, he has been able to cope with these gruesome incidents, although the applicant admits that having young children of his own makes it harder Spending time with his children is a major source of stress relief for the applicant To decompress, candidate plays on-line videogames with several of his buddies from the military, and spends time following Chicago e2 80 99s professional sports teams  Honest and straightforward feedback on his performance; no beating around the bush Encouragement to return to college to complete his degree so as to be eligible for promotion, should he decide to pursue a supervisory position at the agency I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Ruff provided an extensive amount of information and detail regarding his duties and experience while serving with the armed forces in Afghanistan. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On the handwritten exercise, he printed very neatly. Furthermore, on each of the written exercises, this applicant demonstrated excellent writing ability. In particular, the candidate was attentive to the important details and Mr. Ruff wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, while using proper grammar and syntax. As a result of these observations, we expect Mr. Ruff to produce quality police reports as well as handle paperwork in a competent and efficient fashion. The above-reported test scores bode well for Mr. Ruff e2 80 99s overall cognitive mental ability. Besides possessing the proper thinking skills to perform the position in question, we believe that Mr. Ruff is capable of showing empathy and understanding for others. These latter qualities predict positively for the applicant e2 80 99s emotional intelligence.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Ruff to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. The Village of Arlington Heights has the opportunity to gain an experienced officer from a large metropolitan agency, Chicago Police Department. The candidate claims he is looking to relocate from the City of Chicago, but the residency requirements set forth by the Chicago Police Department make it impossible for Mr. Ruff to move to the suburbs and still work for his present employer. Prior to joining the Chicago Police Department, Mr. Ruff served in the military. Over the course of his time in the U.S. Army and with military contractors, Mr. Ruff experienced four deployments, primarily to Afghanistan, but he did spend three months in Iraq. All told, Mr. Ruff was stationed overseas in hostile, war zone environments for 40 months. Between what he saw and experienced with the military as well as during his time with the Chicago Police Department, he is more than well-prepared for the position in question. During his assignment to the Chicago Police Department e2 80 99s 9th District, he has dealt with a wide range of incidents. We were pleasantly surprised that Mr. Ruff has not become jaded or cynical toward the public or the police in spite of his past experiences. In sum, we think that he will bring both perspective and experience to the job. Therefore, in light of our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Ruff be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Arlington Heights. \"',\n",

This candidate already knows what will be expected of him as a probationary firefighter, and we believe he will approach this long sought opportunity with his best foot forward. No significant concerns or reservations about this applicant e2 80 99s capacity to perform the essential job functions effectively. I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Runkel provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background which was appropriately detailed and thorough. We also administered two other written exercises to this individual in which he demonstrated the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, punctuation, and syntax. Mr. Runkel acknowledged that his report writing has improved considerably over the years, as he apparently had some difficulty switching from first to third person in his reports. We do not believe that will be a problem for him at this point in his career. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Runkel to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his academic and occupational accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. Mr. Runkel obtained average grades throughout high school and college, and we suspect that he did not always apply himself as diligently as he could have in formal classroom environments. Coupled with the tragic death of his father during his sophomore year in high school, Mr. Runkel was understandably distracted and unfocused for some time. During his high school years, he was a two-sport athlete and he also worked part-time. Mr. Runkel attended Elgin Community College from 2008 to 2011 while working part-time. To date, he remains one class short of obtaining his associate e2 80 99s degree. We were a bit curious regarding his reason for not finishing that last class over the past eight years, and he said that he has been focusing on his career development and certifications instead. All things considered, Mr. Runkel has already mastered the essential information and skills required of an entry-level firefighter based upon his qualifications and experience.  The youngest of three children, Mr. Runkel was born, raised, and continues to reside in Elgin where he attended local public schools. One of the most significant events in his life occurred when he was a sophomore in high school when his father passed away rather suddenly, which caused him to withdraw from his extracurricular activities in high school and interfered with his focus. With the support and reassurance of his mother and extended family, this individual was able to cope adaptively since that time despite some bumps in the road. In this regard, Mr. Runkel was involved in some teenage hijinks and exercised poor judgment wherein he reportedly stole a shirt at a mall at the age of 14, and was cited for a zero tolerance ticket for possessing alcohol at the age of 16 which caused his driving privileges to be suspended for 90 days. A couple of years later, Mr. Runkel was charged with DUI in 2011 at the age of 20 driving a friend home from his house, but did not have his license suspended. Instead, he did have to pay a fine and attend alcohol treatment and victim panel courses instead. Mr. Runkel also admitted to trying marijuana about five times while he was in high school. Over the past couple of years, Mr. Runkel e2 80 99s consumption of alcohol has decreased significantly and now reports consuming alcohol about six or seven times within the past years. Mr. Runkel expressed regret and remorse for his previous infractions and questionable judgment. On his behalf, this applicant has been consistently employed in some capacity, accomplished established occupational goals, and has never been the recipient of any type of disciplinary action. In addition, he purchased his own townhouse three years ago, manages his finances appropriately, and is now the proud father of a two-year-old daughter, which we believe has propelled him to become more serious about his conduct and maturity. In summation, we believe he has learned from his mistakes and has turned a corner in his life which will culminate in his longtime pursuit of a full-time position with a highly regarded fire department. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Runkel to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a full-time firefighter. As mentioned in  of this report, Mr. Runkel is a positive, hardworking individual who should be able to comfortably integrate among his shift-mates and District personnel rather quickly. In light of our review, we would recommend that Mr. Runkel be given an offer to work as a Full-Time Firefighter for the Algonquin-Lake in the Hills Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

Name: Tay Sanchez Position: Police Officer Age: 27 Department: Police Department Date: November 8, 2019     : Assessment materials completed six days before his appointment at our office Conscientious about the testing process, followed instructions well, and worked within the expressed timelines Punctual and well-prepared;

communicates effectively with others He enhances his credibility when speaking by offering specific examples to make a point Will be open and honest in his dealings with people Overall, rates high on our measures of extraversion as well as agreeableness    : Brings a strong community service outlook to the job Wants to make a positive impact on the lives of other people As a young person, he experienced police officers making a valuable impact on his direction in life, and he wants to return the favor to other, at-risk youth Scored very high on our measures of altruism Moderately high needs for excitement; looks forward to the variety associated with this line of work He is looking for a job in law enforcement where he can make a difference along with a place where he can feel welcomed and like part of a family  relevant work and life experience  : A.A. degree in criminal justice from the College of Lake County B.A. degree in justice studies from Northeastern Illinois University Has served as a foreman for several years at a structural restoration company, where he has had to discipline employees for violations of the work rules Since August of this year, he has been serving in the capacity of an Executive Director for Facilities for a community action partnership, responsible for logistics of the facilities, including safety protocols and maintenance activities    : The four years this person served with Atlas Restoration from May of 2015 until June of this year speaks to his loyalty and dedication to his employer Versatile and flexible , which on occasion, has caused the candidate to be accused of being too accommodating Able to balance his time between attending school and working full-time Rates high on our measures of conscientiousness, especially his need to achieve and advance in responsibility    : Accepts authority and does not seek to push back against his superiors Reports no terminations at any previous place of work Disciplined around four years ago along with the rest of his fellow workers at Atlas Restoration, when according to the candidate, his boss went on a e2 80 9crant e2 80 9d about his employees Nevertheless, he respects a boss who will hold everyone accountable At the same time, the applicant appreciates being recognized for his efforts Responds well to honest and straightforward feedback  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : In his capacity as an Executive Director for Facilities for a community action partnership, the candidate has faced resistance from various individuals For example, the community Director of Head Start has demanded a great deal of the applicant, who according to the candidate, acts with a sense of entitlement Regardless, this person treats everyone with dignity and respect, no matter how abusive the person might act towards him The fact that he is fully bilingual will be an asset to dealing with the members of the Hispanic community On the other hand, his highly accommodating attitude might predict for leniency in his administration of routine traffic laws and city ordinances    : Accepts responsibility for his actions; unlikely to make excuses for his behavior Reports no arrests and only being exposed to marijuana smoke, but never using the substance itself Rarely consumes alcohol At present this person resides at home with his parents along with a sister and an aunt Has been involved in a two and half year relationship He is fiscally responsible, having no debt of any kind, having recently paid off his car loan    : Acknowledges that getting through school was a struggle, but to the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he persevered Has a solid support network of family and friends No harmful habits that would impede his ability to perform his job duties The candidate claims to consume alcohol in moderation To help relieve tension and stress in his life, he enjoys playing and following sports, in paticular football, basketball, and baseball The applicant also exercises between three and four times a week which should help manage stress  Frank feedback aimed at helping him learn from his mistakes Coaching on tempering his accommodating attitude so as not to be overly lenient in the administration of his enforcement duties By his own admission, he could do a better job in developing his conflict resolution skills I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Sanchez submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate as well as containing sufficient detail and information. In addition, the applicant made use of proper spelling and grammar on this particular form. We also administered two other writing samples, which included a mock police report as well as a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career in law enforcement. On both of these exercises, this applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability in terms of employing the appropriate grammar and syntax along with providing the pertinent amount of details. The above-reported scores on  are not surprising since Mr. Sanchez admits that he was never much of a student. We suspect that he was selectively motivated in the classroom, and now that he has found a line of work that he enjoys, he will muster more effort to learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate exhibits empathy for others, which is a major component of emotional intelligence.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Sanchez to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. There is clearly a lot to like about this cheerful and good-natured individual. Able to project a credible police presence, this person will be focused on the community service aspects of the job in question as opposed to seeing his role as all about enforcing the law. In fact, if Mr. Sanchez has an area for further development, we suspect that he might be perceived as too lenient in his administration of routine traffic laws and other city ordinances. On the other hand, when it comes to preventing crime and providing reliable back-up to his fellow officers in need of assistance, we have no qualms about the applicant e2 80 99s ability to act capably in emergency situations. Already experienced in dealing with community relations along with the ability to converse in Spanish, we think that Mr. Sanchez will be an asset to the Department. The candidate claims that as a youngster growing up in the community in neighboring Waukegan, Illinois, Mr. Sanchez came to respect the role of the police. As a result, he wants to replicate the experience for other youngsters, and in particular, those who might be at risk. Regardless, with frank feedback and good coaching we see the candidate as a contributor to the agency. Therefore, in light of our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Sanchez be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Zion. \"',\n",

I Mental Ability  Norms for Firefighters          s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Sarhage submitted a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background which included ample details and a degree of elaboration whenever it was necessary. Coupled with some of his other writing samples, this individual has the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences, and he understands the principles of proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. While may be a bit averse to paperwork (by his own admission), this conscientious individual should be able to produce professional reports and documentation as a firefighter. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Sarhage to possess  mental ability. This assertion is supported by his grades throughout high school and college, and by the manner in which he was able to express his thoughts and ideas (orally and on paper) during his assessment. Mr. Sarhage e2 80 99s below average performance on our standardized test of critical thinking is puzzling, as this mechanically and technologically inclined individual has designed and built functional robots, and his responses to questions regarding novel and ambiguous situations during his interview were logical and rational. Mr. Sarhage obtained his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in engineering technology from Illinois State University in 2015, graduating with a respectable 3.40 GPA. All things considered, Mr. Sarhage is not expected to encounter difficulty mastering the essential information and skills required of a firefighter.  Mr. Sarhage is the second of three children who was born, raised, and continues to reside on Chicago e2 80 99s southwest side where he attended local parochial schools. With this father being a career firefighter with the Chicago Fire Department, his neighborhood was filled with City of Chicago firefighters and police officers due to Chicago e2 80 99s residency requirement. As such, Mr. Sarhage said he literally grew up around the fire service, and often accompanied his father on ride-alongs over the years. According to Mr. Sarhage, his desire was to obtain his associate e2 80 99s degree in fire science and to quickly follow in his father e2 80 99s footsteps after graduating from high school. However, he heeded his parents e2 80 99 advice to obtain a bachelor e2 80 99s degree in a different vocational area as a e2 80 9cback-up plan. e2 80 9d A mechanically and technologically-inclined individual, Mr. Sarhage went on to obtain a degree engineering technology, which he enjoyed very much. So much so, that he was involved with the university e2 80 99s robotics club and competed with his classmates at the national level, winning second place in a competition with some of the top engineering schools in the country (Purdue, Kansas State, Illinois, etc.) who were allotted significantly large budgets to create the required robot as part of the competition. Mr. Sarhage and his peers took second place with only $2,000 to work with while the others had $50,000 budgets. Mr. Sarhage was very proud of that accomplishment. We expect Mr. Sarhage to bring with him that same type of resourcefulness, collaboration, and mission orientation to the position of a firefighter. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Sarhage to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question, as he received either e2 80 9cacceptable e2 80 9d or e2 80 9cstrong e2 80 9d ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success for the position in question besides his  to date. A bright and energetic individual, this candidate is expected to catch on rather quickly during his academy time and probationary period.

Moreover, because of the unique combination of skills required for each position, this report pertains to the job in question, only. Therefore, this report is not intended to be used for decisions about future promotions.  Name: Brett Sarnecke Position: Police Officer Age: 24 Department: Police Department Date: February 14, 2019     : Neatly groomed with the exception of his unshaven face, which seems to be in style these days Professionally attired in a business suit and tie Youthful appearance may work against him being perceived as an authoritative figure Energetic and rather talkative; easy to engage in conversation Will be seen as approachable    : Exceptionally outgoing and gregarious Tends to be rather chatty, and even more so when feeling uncomfortable Can provide more information than is either asked or required of him Projects a positive attitude, which predicts positively for contributing to good morale in the department Eager to please people, and wants to be well-liked by his peers Will defer to the experience and expertise of the more senior officers in the agency Will be seen as flexible and responsive to the requests of his fellow police officers    : Has enjoyed serving in roles where he has been able to assist others, such as those in es and customer service Believes that working in the community will be rewarding Appreciates the potential element of surprise associated with police work; looks forward to the variety and excitement of the job Being part of a team with the common goal of serving the public is very appealing to this applicant  relevant work and life experience  : At one time gave serious thought to a medically-oriented profession, and hence he has experience in EMS and a degree in physical therapy Since committing to a career entirely in law enforcement, he has been working toward his online degree in criminology and criminal justice through Arizona State University Admits he has no practical experience working jobs directly related to law enforcement He has supervised in the past at a retail, sporting goods store Significant customer service experience, also while working in retail store operations    : Conscientious and eager to show others that he can carry his own weight Will be diligent in handling his duties and responsibilities Even though he likes the potential for variety and excitement associated with the job, he will still complete mundane tasks, like paperwork, in a meticulous manner Prides himself on his dependability as he rarely, if ever, calls off sick or tardy for his shift assignment Has been told that he is a good performer by his bosses, but he could do more to master the finer points of his work    : Raised to show respect for authority; reports no arrests Has never been terminated from any previous place of work His only disciplinary action came during the Christmas season for clowning around at work before customers arrived at his store Responds well to a supervisor who possesses a positive attitude and makes work fun At the same time he understands the need for firm, but fair guidance and direction  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : We rate this individual as marginal for his lack of enforcement experience Given his need to be well-liked, we suspect this individual might show signs of leniency While he has had supervisory responsibility, he has not needed to exercise his authority by coming down hard on employees or discipline them On this dimension, the candidate will likely be a work-in-progress until he gains time and experience on the job    : Despite the observation that this person wants to please people and put his best foot forward, we do not believe that he will be prone to excuse-making in order to save face The applicant offered examples of when he has received critical feedback on his job performance and how he has acted to correct his behavior In short, he will hold himself accountable Although, still residing at home, the candidate is engaged to be married to a young woman who he has known since high school Paid for part of his college education and handles himself in a fiscally responsible fashion    : Unlikely to leave the job prematurely if it is offered to him Applicant acknowledges that he is bothered by seeing harm done to children To reduce tension and stress, he relies on a small group of family and friends for support Applicant also exercises several times a week, and when possible, plays internet videogames with a childhood friend who lives out-of-state Has no harmful habits that would impair his ability to perform the job Rarely consumes alcohol  This rather talkative individual might feel the need to fill the silence when engaged with his fellow officers; a reminder to maintain his composure and listen more than talk might be helpful. An experiential learner, this person will do best when given a chance to observe the more seasoned fellow officers handling difficult calls, like domestic disputes, before operating himself under supervision I        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Sarnecke took the time to offer accurate and complete information, which predicts positively for handling the paperwork and report writing requirements of the position in question. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On each of these exercises, Mr. Sarnecke demonstrated acceptable writing ability by being attentive to detail, and writing in clear and complete sentences using proper grammar and syntax. The above-reported test results are not reflective of the candidate e2 80 99s true cognitive capabilities. We sense that Mr. Sarnecke is an experiential learner, who profits from observing others as well as the lessons gleaned from his own experiences. Mr. Sarnecke also appears gifted with a high emotional intelligence, as he was raised with moral values such as consideration and respecting other people e2 80 99s feelings and concerns. We observed this trait during our interview with the candidate in his ability to show empathy for others. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Sarnecke to possess the proper thinking skills as they pertain to the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Sarnecke to be an acceptable applicant for the position in question. There is a lot that we like about this alert and eager individual. The candidate claims that his interest in law enforcement stretches back to his childhood. According to the candidate, however, both of his parents pushed him to consider a medically-oriented profession. As a result, he has worked in the field of EMS as a Medicar Driver as well as a physical therapist, where he is currently employed with TI Physical Therapy. Mr. Sarnecke has always enjoyed being part of a team with a common goal. For example, he played high school sports and took them very seriously, before a broken ankle during his senior year ended his hopes for a college football scholarship. Most of this person e2 80 99s work experience has been in retail es, and in particular, the selling of sporting goods. While Mr. Sarnecke brings to the job a good customer service background, he is light on enforcement experience. Once Mr. Sarnecke has been trained and built up some assertiveness and authoritative bearing, he will likely benefit from extra coaching and guidance on handling potentially volatile citizen encounters, such as domestic disputes. Conscientious, hardworking, and well-intended, this person should prove open to feedback and eager to use constructive criticism to his advantage. Therefore, in light of our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Sarnecke be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of South Elgin. \"',\n",

Name: Adam Schallmoser Position: Firefighter Age: 25 Department: Fire Department Date: January 16, 2020   y  : Struck us as jumpy and excitable when expressing his thoughts Communication leaves little doubt where he stands; not afraid to let people know what is on his mind For example, while working in food services during college the candidate described the students as e2 80 9canimals e2 80 9d in reference to being messy and not cleaning up after themselves On the other hand, the candidate was careful to note that he wants to avoid coming across as e2 80 9ctoo abrasive e2 80 9d or e2 80 9ctoo brash, e2 80 9d especially since he will be new to the department In short, he wants to avoid violating the departments e2 80 9cunwritten rules e2 80 9d In his behalf, this person seems positive and sincere about pursuing a career in the fire service Moderately outgoing and gregarious individual with a background in competitive sports; this person swam in high school Should integrate into the department about as quickly as any new hire  AND PERSONA   : Seems sincere in wanting to make a positive impact on the community Scored extremely high on our measure of altruism In his free time during high school, this person participated in volunteer work with his Church youth group Sees the fire service as an opportunity to build a sense of pride in himself Drawn to the variety and high degree of activity involved in a career in the fire service and EMS Rates quite high on our measures of excitement-seeking Looks forward to the camaraderie associated with the fire service     : Four year college degree in sociology was aimed at helping him prepare for a career in public safety, as either a police officer or a firefighter; decided on the latter career option during his senior year in college EMT-B in 2017 from Harper College and Northwest Community Hospital Paramedic license in 2019, also from Harper College and Northwest Community Hospital B.O.F. certification in 2019 through NIPSTA Since graduating from the academy sponsored through NIPSTA, this person has only been on the job one month He did, however, do his ride time with the Palatine Fire Department In addition to possessing relevant work and life experience, this candidate is appropriately mature Expected to honor his commitments and obligations No brushes with law enforcement Reports never having used any kind of illegal substance We believe he fully understands the imperative that being a public servant requires him to be alert, attentive, and focused without the residual effects of any type of substance (legal or illegal)     : Views the fire service and EMS as meaningful work Eager to learn and expand his skill set While generally conscientious, we observed that he missed a few details about the waivers required for the assessment process, and he needed reminding several times to complete these forms properly Active, energetic, and dedicated individual with a strong work ethic Serious about his duties and essential job functions Has had positive relationships with most of the authority figures in his life Applicant has followed the rules throughout most of his life Has never been fired from any previous place of employment However, he was disciplined at his college dining job and felt that the actions taken against him were unfair He might not always be open-minded and receptive to constructive criticism In short, he could be defensive when confronted about behavior that needs changing Moreover, he might not agree with the all of the department e2 80 99s policies and procedures  ability to cope with stress, remain composed, be assertive  : Anxious in many ways, handling emergencies and trauma will present a challenge for the candidate By his own admission, the applicant acknowledged that he can be excitable For example, his fellow fire medics have noted that the applicant tends to raise his voice and yell when feeling excitable Because of the stress of the role, this person has shown a tendency to develop tunnel vision and not be attentive to other important cues in his surroundings We are also concerned that the candidate is relatively inexperienced when it comes to emergencies and trauma Along this same line, the applicant admits that the most serious emergency that he has witnessed firsthand was a young woman with slit wrists who was bleeding rather profusely Small but supportive base of family and a couple of close friends Possesses no potentially harmful habits that would impair his performance on the job; for example, he consumes alcohol in moderation Committed to the fire service and unlikely to leave for another line of work  Coaching on how to handle emergencies and trauma in a calm and composed fashion Caution about reacting defensively to constructive feedback I        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Schallmoser submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate, but not particularly detailed. In his behalf, Mr. Schallmoser took steps to use proper spelling and grammar on his Personal History Form. We also administered another writing sample, which included a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the applicant e2 80 99s career. On this exercise, this applicant demonstrated acceptable writing ability. Specifically, Mr. Schallmoser used the appropriate grammar and syntax, and he did a reasonably effective job of providing the pertinent details. The score recorded by Mr. Schallmoser on his  is encouraging and predictive of positive outcomes on the job. All things considered, the candidate has the ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. In the case of this candidate, we did not observe him to be especially emotionally intelligent, but with the proper coaching and guidance, he might be capable of acquiring it.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Schallmoser to be a marginally acceptable applicant for the position in question, largely because of our concerns about his composure at the scene of an accident or an emergency. While our findings based on Mr. Schallmoser e2 80 99s self-report lead us to conclude that the candidate is not yet ready for the position in question, we have received information from the command staff at the hiring department that contradicts our findings. More specifically, the command staff has been made aware through reference checks that Mr. Schallmoser has performed acceptably under pressure during emergency situations. The references are from his present department and others who have had contact with Mr. Schallmoser under emergency conditions. Our conclusions, however, are based on the applicant e2 80 99s admission that his fellow firefighter/paramedics have described him as e2 80 9cloud, e2 80 9d e2 80 9cexcitable, e2 80 9d and given to e2 80 9cyelling e2 80 9d at the scene of an emergency. Clearly, his statements are at variance with those of the references that were offered on Mr. Schallmoser. There are a couple of ways to resolve the issue. One suggestion would be to re-interview Mr. Schallmoser by the command staff in order to discuss the topic further and get to the bottom of the contradictory findings to help allay these concerns. Another suggestion might be to proceed with Mr. Schallmoser e2 80 99s hiring and carefully monitor his progress during his probationary period to see how he fares. Afterall, there is a lot we like about Mr. Schallmoser e2 80 99s candidacy. He is positive and sincere, mature, and wants to be proud of the work he does. Active and energetic, with a strong work ethic, he scored well on several of the dimensions connected with success as a firefighter. While we would be reluctant to recommend that Mr. Schallmoser be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Palatine Rural Fire Protection District because of the concerns over his composure, the command staff might be willing to override our concerns and give the applicant a chance to perform the job. \"',\n",

Name: Blake Schwarz Position: Police Officer Age: 22 Department: Police Department Date: June 5, 2019     : Professionally attired in a suit and tie and well-groomed for his appointment at our office Stiff, monotone communication style; will be seen as impersonal and less than approachable Soft spoken and hard to hear at times Demonstrated awkward mannerisms in the way he expresses himself    : Minimal self-awareness and awareness of others; he will not show much empathy Not likely to find much in common with his fellow officers Struggles to work with others who are e2 80 9cintentionally disobedient e2 80 9d; he needs to improve his abilities to engage in effective conflict resolution Very bothered by injustices; this person will be rigidly fair to those around him Not likely to be viewed as a credible or dependable back-up officer due to his quirky mannerisms, disconnected social style, and inability to employ flexible thinking    : We suspect that his interest in police work has more to do with improving his sense of who he is and being viewed as an authoritative figure than he would care to admit Was jumped by a group of college students in 2017; when the police responded to the situation, he realized he wanted to become a police officer Wants to be e2 80 9cexpected and respected e2 80 9d in a position of authority Comes across as wanting power and autonomy; he is looking forward to enforcing the laws and deciding how to allocate his time during a day on the job In his behalf, he seems to have genuine respect for the field  relevant work and life experience  : Graduated in 2017 from Sauk Valley Community College with an associate e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice Has not completed an internship or any ride time Earned an assistant manager position in the shipping yard at Menards the second time he applied for it; he is very much enjoying his managerial status Although he has had some beneficial customer service experience working in retail and in the restaurant industry, this applicant has not had direct experience with emergencies    : Consistently employed in some capacity since high school Punctual and dependable; never late and does not take any sick days, according to him Task-oriented; works well with extremely clear guidelines and expectations Average needs for achievement and competence; will do what is expected of him Motivated by promotions; he takes his managerial responsibilities seriously This dimension is a relative strength for this individual    : Though he will treat those in authority with respect, this candidate will not adapt easily to a paramilitary setting Expects his supervisors to be fair and consistent Has received critical feedback about his inability to change and incorporate flexible thinking skills on the job Received one disciplinary write-up at his current job for arguing with his manager about the schedule; reported no history of terminations Will try to be receptive to criticism, but integrating any critical feedback will be hard for this person  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Disconnected interpersonal style will significantly impact his credibility and capacity to project an authoritative bearing Does not appear to handle ambiguity or moderate amounts of stress or pressure well; will become rigid and inflexible in the face of challenges Inflated sense of his own maturity and capability, which could lead to officer safety issues; views himself in a different way than others will perceive him We do not believe this applicant has a realistic perception of what will be required of him as a police officer in terms of the enforcement aspects of the job    : Lacks social maturity and awareness especially as it pertains to his ability to function capably as a police officer Although he reported some shortcomings, he has not done much to change these areas of deficiency On that note, he will be able to take responsibility for task-oriented, clear-cut mistakes; yet, he will not be able to assume responsibility when a mishap is more complex or related to his  In his behalf, no reported history of arrests, has had only one speeding ticket, and rarely consumes alcohol    : Will become easily riled by stressful or ambiguous situations that police officers face often When he becomes stressed at his current place of work, he seeks clarification Given his highly rigid way of being, this candidate is susceptible to cracking under pressure In his behalf, this person enjoys boxing, ju-jitsu, and spending time with his family members and girlfriend to relax However, overall this applicant is not a very good fit for a law enforcement career, as he will encounter inordinate difficulty dealing with the ambiguity and complicated challenges that he will face in this line of work  We cannot offer any recommendations regarding this applicant e2 80 99s training to improve performance regarding the essential job functions required of a police officer, as he presented with a number of concerns involving his social/emotional functioning, which will not be dramatically changed by specialized training or further education. I        s)       Overall, we evaluate Mr. Schwarz to possess  mental ability. This assertion is based upon his academic grades throughout high school and college, and by his scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above. Accordingly, he graduated high school with a 3.7/4.0 GPA and earned a 3.6/4.0 GPA from Sauk Valley Community College. With respect to his writing ability, Mr. Schwarz can express himself on paper in clear and coherent sentences that generally contain proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. While he possesses the intellectual capacity to learn the essential information required for the position in question, this individual e2 80 99s marginal social skills will significantly impede his ability to apply that information in the actual performance of his duties as a police officer. For example, the way he comprehends and communicates information might be quite different from his fellow officers. Rigid and socially awkward with a low tolerance for stress and frustration, we expect this candidate to be quickly overwhelmed during his field training and probationary period.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Schwarz to be an unacceptable applicant for the position in question, as he received unfavorable ratings on most of the dimensions connected with success as a police officer. Mr. Schwarz was born and raised in Ashton, Illinois, which he described as a e2 80 9ccornfield e2 80 9d town. When the candidate was born, his biological mother was 15 years old and his biological father was only 13 years old. Mr. Schwarz recalled growing up quickly and playing a big role in raising his younger brother. Although this candidate is not suited to be a police officer, he sure is resilient in some ways, especially pertaining to supporting his family. Rules, structure, and consistency are things that Mr. Schwarz seeks out in his life. This rigid individual seems to have good intentions, but his social and emotional intelligence are not sufficiently developed to deal with the world of law enforcement. Throughout this report, we have documented our many concerns about this applicant e2 80 99s potential to succeed in this line of work, and we anticipate that it will be an exercise in frustration for all concerned to even attempt to remediate some of his longstanding and deeply ingrained personality characteristics. We did not get a definitive sense of this candidate e2 80 99s motivation or rationale for pursuing a law enforcement career other than his frequently repeated desire to exercise authority. From a psychological perspective, we strongly suspect that Mr. Schwarz wants to become a police officer to validate himself and earn the respect of others, which he appears to lack for himself. Along this line, he possesses an inflated sense of his assertiveness, capabilities, and social skills, which will lead to officer safety concerns. Mr. Schwarz has not progressed past his oral interviews with at least two police agencies in the Chicago area recently, and we believe that other evaluators may have noticed his inflexible demeanor. Therefore, in light of our many concerns and reservations, we would recommend that the City of Dekalb take a pass on Mr. Schwarz and continue to search for more suitable candidates to serve as a Police Officer for the Department.
