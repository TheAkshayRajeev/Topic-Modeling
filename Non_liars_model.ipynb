Name: Aaron Barnes Position: Firefighter Age: 28 Department: Fire Department Date: May 21, 2019     : Unprofessionally attired in jeans and a plaid shirt for his appointment at our office Avoided eye contact and spoke slowly; he struggled to express himself in a clear and straightforward manner Furthermore, this candidate was deceptive in providing information in the written material requested by him as part of his test protocol for our evaluation process When he did respond, his answers were brief, incomplete, and rather unusual Unfortunately, we believe that his communication skills will impact his credibility as a firefighter; he will be unable to develop a working rapport with most people Came across as detached and unapproachable, which will be readily noticed by citizens in the community and coworkers  y  : Socially and emotionally inept; he is a solitary individual who prefers to be alone This candidate will have a tough time finding his place in a new department; he has a hard time communicating and can come off as disconnected To elaborate on his communication skills, he said things like, e2 80 9cyou can change their life in a good impression e2 80 9d; he mixed up his words and did not make sense at times It will not take his fellow firefighters very long to realize that they will not be able to rely on this candidate Hot tempered and easily frustrated individual; he struggles to contain his frustrations and is liable to get angry with others    : Experiences feelings of inferiority and wants to be recognized more than he wants to help other people Hopes to become a e2 80 9csilent hero e2 80 9d one day, which speaks to his need to be admired and respected Being a part of Boy Scouts of America as a child made him aware of public safety Appreciates the hours and schedule that a job as a firefighter offers    : Reportedly worked towards an associate e2 80 99s degree at McHenry County College, but due to his lack of clarity and accurate reporting, we were unable to discern if he actually obtained a degree or not EMT-B certification in October of 2018 after failing in his first two attempts Worked as a paid on-call recruit for Richmond Fire Department (2016-2017) for approximately 12 hours a week; disappointingly he was let go as a result of failing to obtain his EMT-B certification within the timeline given by the department Previously worked as a teller for Golden Eagle Community Bank (2015-2016); terminated for lacking professionalism Presently works at Schultz Farm and Grain Inc., where he has been since nuary of 2017 as a general laborer on their farm   : Lacks conscientiousness, self-discipline, and focus; evidenced in his erratic work history Reportedly shows up late to work approximately a dozen times a year Failed his EMT-B courses two times before finally passing the third time; he attributed his failures due to his struggles with dyslexia Based on his performance at our office, we believe his lack of focus and motivation was the cause of his failures Terminated from his last two jobs Selectively motivated to a fault; he will choose the tasks and activities in which he wants to participate    : Fellow firefighters will not be able to depend on this person; he will require assistance and constant supervision from anyone with whom he works Spoke negatively and disrespectfully about all of his supervisors; will not hesitate to voice his opinion when he disagrees with direct orders Stated, e2 80 9cWhen someone gives me feedback, I listen to a point, but if it e2 80 99s negative, I will turn a deaf ear e2 80 9d This outspoken and defensive individual prefers to work with a supervisor who in his own words, e2 80 9cdoesn e2 80 99t have their head too far up their own ass e2 80 9d For example, when warned about cell phone use at the bank that employed him, he exclaimed e2 80 9cwhat the hell e2 80 9d to his supervisor in front of customers, which resulted in his termination    : There is nothing in this candidate e2 80 99s history or background that indicates he is competent in any area of functioning Will lack tact and organization when responding to emergency situations Likely to stumble over his words and become flustered in the face of an emergency; likely to be erratic and unprepared Liable to forget important information related to protocols and procedures If he gets any pushback from members of the public, he will match anger with anger    : Has a history of not directly taking responsibility for his actions; rather he will become angry and assign blame to someone else whenever possible This candidate has lived under his parents e2 80 99 roof for his entire life, and we do not envision that changing any time soon No discernable awareness of his deficits or weaknesses Has held four jobs since high school and was terminated from two of them; he blamed his previous bosses for the terminations Received seven traffic tickets for speeding, one for a minor car accident, and one for drunk driving The DUI was dropped down to a reckless driving misdemeanor after he fought it in court Consumes an excessive amount of alcohol two or more times a week; if he is driving, he claims to have e2 80 9cabout four drinks, e2 80 9d and if he is not driving, he will have about eight Admitted to accruing over $7,000 in debt for watching online pornography    : Unstable and maladjusted individual; nowhere near establishing himself as an independent or autonomous adult Easily frustrated and inappropriate response to stressful situations; maladaptive coping strategies such as alcohol abuse and excessive use of online pornography Will not find much support from his fellow firefighters when he is under stress given his inability to connect with others Unable to sustain lengthy employment at previous jobs Overall, this candidate is not a very good fit for any type of public safety work Special Training, Orientation & Concerns This candidate does not possess the cognitive, emotional, or social skills to succeed as a firefighter/paramedic. Unfortunately, his personality characteristics and immaturity will impede his ability to benefit from any kind of training or education at this time.        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, he submitted all of the required paperwork, although he only partially completed the forms. Mr. Barnes was selective about the information he provided, and deliberately omitted many key facts about his personal and occupational history. When he did respond, his responses were overly concise and written in phrases and clauses. This candidate struggles to effectively get his points across when using both verbal and written communication. Mr. Barnes has noticeable deficiencies in grammar, punctuation, and clarity which are reflective of his lackadaisical approach to completing formal documents. On that note, we also administered two other writing samples (both typed). In these exercises, Mr. Barnes provided the shortest possible answers and did not fill out areas which he did not feel like completing. From our perspective, this candidate will not produce adequate documentation for the position in question, which we attribute to his lack of motivation and interest in fulfilling requirements. Mr. Barnes e2 80 99 scores on our standardized tests are quite low, which are consistent with the reported difficultly he has had academically. It should be noted that this candidate reported having an unspecified diagnosis of dyslexia. Mr. Barnes stated that in grade school he did receive some specialized classroom support for this diagnosis, we do not see his reported dyslexia as being the major factor inhibiting him from mastering the required job duties of a firefighter/paramedic. We see this candidate e2 80 99s deficiencies being more attributable to his general lack of self-discipline, focus, and social skills. From all indications, this candidate does not have the capacity to master the essential information required to perform this job.  Mr. Barnes currently resides with his biological parents in McHenry, Illinois, where he was born and raised with his two older brothers. This person continues to live a rather solitary and seemingly relegated life in his parents e2 80 99 home. Over the years, this candidate has had difficulties integrating socially and maintaining any consistent employment. Mr. Barnes claims that one of his proudest accomplishments was being an assistant patroller in his grade school years. According to the candidate, his ultimate desire is to be known as a e2 80 9csilent hero e2 80 9d; fighting wildfires in rural areas of the country, and living a solitary life in a cabin in the woods. From all indications this candidate is pursuing a career in the fire service not so much to service the public, but rather to receive acknowledgement from others that he has failed to obtain thus far in his life. These are not good reasons alone for pursuing a career in public safety. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Barnes to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. Though he worked briefly for the Richmond Fire Department a few years ago, his employment there was terminated. Despite his desire to pursue a career in this field, he has not demonstrated at this point in time that he is able to do this job. Mr. Barnes is likely to resist authority, demonstrate a low tolerance for frustration and stress, and will struggle to perform his job duties due to his low motivation and discipline. Overall, in light of our numerous reservations and concerns, we would not recommend that Mr. Barnes be given an offer to work as a Firefighter intern for the Algonquin-Lake in the Hills FPD.

Name: Ryan Bachman Position: Firefighter Age: 30 Department: Fire Department Date: September 24, 2019     : Approached his exercises in a timely and conscientious manner Arrived 30 mins early for his appointment at our office Appropriately attired for his appointment, dressed in a suit and tie Presented himself as polite; offered a firm handshake Overall, this individual presented himself as a credible candidate for the position in question  y  : Expresses himself in a matter of fact manner Will be straightforward and direct in his dealings with his colleagues in the department Appreciates the camaraderie connected with working alongside his fellow firefighters In general, e2 80 9cbeing around the guys e2 80 9d has been a major source of satisfaction for him Working around know-it-alls or those firefighters with family in the fire service who feel that they are entitled to the job, are annoying to him When encountering such individuals, the candidate avoids confrontations with them; instead, will take the matter up with his superiors if things are interfering with the job Overall, he should prove to be a good team player    : Mentions helping people as one of his attractions to the fire service and EMS An avid ice hockey player, the  believes that being a firefighter/paramedic allows him to stay in good physical condition The job is also challenging in that it forces firefighters and medics to constantly learn new way of performing their jobs Finally, as mentioned above, the fellowship of the fire service is appealing to this     : Earned his EMT-B from Moraine Valley Community College in 2016 Received his B.O.F. through the Romeoville Fire Academy, also in 2016 In 2018, the  was awarded his paramedic e2 80 99s license through Ingalls Hospital and South Suburban College Currently, a firefighter/paramedic at the Central Stickney Fire Protection District; he was hired by the district in May of 2017 Has been a firefighter/paramedic with the Evergreen Fire Department since July of 2018 Joined the Palos Fire Protection District as a firefighter/paramedic in July of this year   : As noted from a listing of the  e2 80 99s job experience, he is currently working three jobs According to the candidate, this results in working anywhere from 72 to 96 hours a week Possesses a solid work ethic At the same time, with high needs for variety and excitement, this individual can become easily bored with mundane or routine tasks He was recently verbally reprimanded for applying a series of license plate stickers in a less than conscientious fashion On other occasions, he has been less than diligent about checking his rig before hitting the street In sum, he shows classic signs of selective motivation    : This person reports no disciplinary actions taken against him at any place of work Additionally, he reports never having been terminated from any of his prior employers This person only expressed positive thoughts about his past and present supervisors Responds well to leadership by example, and in particular, a supervisor who will work alongside of him, performing such routine tasks as checking the rigs Along this same line, having an upbeat and positive leader makes his job easier    : Experienced in dealing with emergencies and trauma Most of the fatalities that he has encountered were the result of cardiac arrests, some of which coded on him during treatment He can show empathy for both the victims as well as the members of their family; he cited a disturbing shooting incident, where children were present in the house    : The candidate has had no arrests and never used or experimented with any kind of illegal substance On the other hand, this candidate does consume alcohol in excess (eight to ten beers in an evening) This person presently lives with his parents, and he has just started a dating relationship with a nurse he met while on duty This individual has been fiscally responsible, carrying a manageable amount of debt from his student loans and his truck He has reduced his student loan debt by more than a fourth    : This person has persevered acceptably, thus far, in his career in the fire service and EMS He possesses a number of outlets to help him relieve tension and stress e2 80 93 some productive and others more harmful The  is an avid ice hockey player and plays in an adult men e2 80 99s league on a regular basis On the other hand, the  admits that he consumes a significant amount of alcohol a couple of times a week In particular, he will drink anywhere from eight to ten beers when out with friends, which could lead to an unwanted, and possibly, career-ending DUI arrest Special Training, Orientation & Concerns A reminder to the candidate about showing signs of selective motivation when it comes to routine and less exciting tasks, like checking his rig before shift According to the candidate, learining to communicate more effectively is another area where he can always improve Caution to the candidate about his alcohol consumption which can range from eight to ten beers a couple of times a month; this person is placing himself in jeopardy of an unwanted D       s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Bachman provided accurate information on his Personal History Form. While his level of detail on his Personal History Form was not very extensive, he went out of his way to provide clear and well-written explanations for both a highlight and a setback that he encountered during the course of his career. The fact that he wrote so well on his Highlights and Setbacks Exercise is reassuring given the need for him to handle paperwork and report writing responsibilities as a fire medic. We are also reassured by the  e2 80 99s mental abilities as measured on the . This candidate is bright. For example, he earned his B.A. degree from a well-regarded, small liberal arts college in Michigan. In particular, Mr. Bachman is a 2014 graduate of Adrian College, where he majored in exercise science. At one time, this person was interested in becoming a chiropractor. Unfortunately Mr. Bachman did not perform well in classes aimed at achieving his doctorate in chiropractic science. According to the candidate, he simply fell behind in his studies. Regardless, we evaluate the  as able to continue mastering all of the essential elements to becoming a successful firefighter/paramedic.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Bachman to be an acceptable  for the position in question. As we mentioned above, the candidate wanted to be a chiropractor, and toward that end, he enrolled in a program designed to earn a doctorate in his chosen field around 2014. However, the course of study was very demanding, and the candidate could not keep up with his studies. As a result, he fell behind and had to leave school, abandoning his hope of becoming a chiropractor. According to the candidate, he had a brother-in-law who was serving with the Chicago Fire Department. This latter individual encouraged Mr. Bachman to consider a career in the fire service. A couple of years later in 2016, Mr. Bachman earned his EMT-B at Moraine Valley Community College. Since that time, this individual has been steadily earning the proper certifications and licenses to become a firefighter/paramedic. In addition, the candidate is currently serving in good standing at three different fire departments and protection districts in Palos, Evergreen Park, and Central Stickney. Hardworking and able to get along with his fellow fire medics, we think that Mr. Bachman will make a good addition to the department in Palos on a full-time basis. However, his selective motivation will require monitoring along with a word of caution about his alcohol consumption after hours. Nevertheless, in light of our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Bachman be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Palos Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

Name: Nicholas Barnas Position: Police Officer Age: 32 Department: Police Department Date: April 17, 2019     : Clean-cut and neatly groomed for his appointment at our office Professionally attired in a dress shirt, tie, and slacks Offered a firm handshake and carried himself with confidence Prefers to talk more than listen; rather longwinded Likely to be authoritative; probably will not be perceived as very approachable Although he presents himself as credible and professional at first; concerns were exposed during his evaluation at our office  y  : Lacks empathy and compassion; he will not give others the benefit of the doubt nor will he be able to connect easily with others Incredibly rigid; this person is likely to become reactive when those around him do not closely follow the rules On the other hand, this candidate seems to feel like he is above the rules even though he very much enjoys enforcing them on other people Admitted that he has not been in a committed relationship since 2010; this supports our observation that interpersonal relationships are challenging for him    : Decided to pursue a career in law enforcement after a horrific school shooting occurred in 2005 at Northern Illinois University while he was studying to become a teacher Wants to give back to the community by enforcing rules to promote safety Appreciates the way people work together within a department Values the safety of himself, law enforcement officers, and members of the public  relevant work and life experience  : Received his B.S. in physical education in 2009 from Northern Illinois University M.S. degree in health from Western Illinois University obtained in 2011 Since nuary of 2019 has been employed as a corrections officer for MCC Chicago in the Federal Bureau of Prisons From nuary of 2015 to nuary of 2019 this candidate worked at Dunbar Armored as an ATM supervisor; he was eventually promoted to a crew chief position Since July of 2014 until February of 2019 this person volunteered as an emergency services officer for New Lenox E.S.D.A. where he assisted the police force in activities such as monitoring community concerts and recreating accident scenes   : Employed since the age of 16; his first job was working as a lifeguard Was terminated from his lifeguard position in 2010 for having inappropriate conversations on the job and showing up late Stated that he is determined to do his job well, and that he values quality work over e2 80 9cmaking friends e2 80 9d on the job According to this candidate, most of his supervisors would see him as hardworking Reports to rarely be late and that he has only taken one sick day in the last five years Admits that his overly eager attitude causes him to take on too many responsibilities    : Prefers a supervisor who will work with their team, be helpful, and offer support Spoke negatively about some of his past supervisors Not open to feedback; he will likely become defensive in the face of constructive feedback and make elaborate excuses for his actions Scored low on our measures of dutifulness, which is consistent with our observations that lead us to believe he would rather choose which of the rules apply to him  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : While this person said, e2 80 9cI e2 80 99m not a hot-head, e2 80 9d he presented as one during our evaluation, which will make it hard for him to consistently employ tact in enforcement situations For example, when he was in a supervisory role at Dunbar Armored, he got into a verbal altercation with one of his supervisees, which resulted in a disciplinary write-up for the candidate When given a hypothetical situation that he might face with as an officer, this candidate demonstrated rigidity and lacked compassion In his behalf, he has been in charge of 88 inmates for the last four months at his current job    : Made excuses for every time he was reportedly in trouble For example, he was arrested for a physical altercation with his girlfriend and said it was because e2 80 9cthe door ricocheted off of my foot and hit her in the face e2 80 9d When this person was terminated from his lifeguard job in 2010, he blamed his supervisor for e2 80 9ceavesdropping e2 80 9d Additionally, he was written up for a verbal altercation for which he said, e2 80 9cit had nothing to do with me, e2 80 9d even though he went on to describe himself screaming at an employee In his behalf, he claims to rarely consume alcohol, and has minimal unpaid financial obligations    : In the past this person has become reactive when the stress at work became too much for him to handle For example, when a supervisee was not following the rules, the candidate reacted by yelling at her His e2 80 9chot-head e2 80 9d characteristics might arise when stress at work exceeds his threshold To elaborate, he has become stressed and overly reactive in situations at work that appear to be less stressful than some he would face as a police officer Has ready support from his two roommates and his family of origin To relax outside of work, this person relies on watching television, working out three to four times a week, riding his motorcycle, and going on hunting trips  Serious concerns about this person e2 80 99s tendency to shirk any responsibility for his actions This person lacks compassion and will likely prove to be rigid to work with; these personality traits will be very hard to change through training Cautions about this person e2 80 99s , he is going to struggle fitting in on a new department        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s online materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Barnas provided us with the proper information and details. We also administered another writing sample. On this exercise, this  demonstrated acceptable writing ability. Even though what he stated in writing demonstrates his lack of tact and compassion, he was able to get his points across successfully. Mr. Barnas was attentive to the details on his Personal History Form, and expressed himself in clear, definitive, and complete sentences with just a few minor grammatical errors. As such, we are surprised by Mr. Barnas e2 80 99 poor performance on the verbal portion of the . We make this statement in light of the fact that the  is well-educated. In particular, he has earned both a B.S. degree in physical education from Northern Illinois University and an M.S. degree in health from Western Illinois University. Our only plausible explanation is that this less than conscientious candidate probably did little to apply himself when taking our battery of standardized tests at our office during the assessment process. Although Mr. Barnas might be able to complete the required paperwork in an acceptable manner for the position in question, he lacks the social and emotional skills to effectively carry out the required duties of the job. To elaborate, the lack of compassion and maturity demonstrated by Mr. Barnas do not bode well for his long-term success as a law enforcement officer.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Barnas to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. Mr. Barnas was born and raised in Frankfort, Illinois, where he lived with his parents until he went to college. He then returned to his parents e2 80 99 home until he moved out with roommates approximately two years ago. Although he is 32 years old, he acts in a manner befitting a much younger candidate for a law enforcement position. Mr. Barnas is an excitement-seeking individual who would rather enforce rules than follow them. He genuinely seems to value the enforcement aspect of police work; however, he does not have the capacity to tactfully enforce rules that promote public safety. On another note, Mr. Barnas is someone who would rather talk than listen and might have a hard time adjusting to a paramilitary setting working inside a police department. In his behalf, Mr. Barnas currently works as a corrections officer, and appears to have been successful so far maintaining an even temperament. Nevertheless, we have highlighted our concerns about him becoming reactive and assigning blame to others. Mr. Barnas e2 80 99 level of professionalism has been called into question on various occasions throughout his employment history. His lack of self-awareness and maturity level will not lend themselves well to becoming an effective police officer. Therefore, in light of our highly cautious review, we would not recommend that Mr. Barnas be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Matteson. ERL/\"',\n",

We believe he has already been able to demonstrate his competence in performing essential job functions to his supervisors, but may require a bit of encouragement to continually improve himself throughout the course of his career. As such, he may need a bit of e2 80 9cexternal motivation e2 80 9d in order to do so as he appears to be somewhat mired in his comfort zone right now. Will need to do a better job of report writing and documentation. Apparently has been e2 80 9ccounseled e2 80 9d about this previously.  has the ability to write thorough and detailed reports, but may not apply himself as well as he could in this regard.        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Bayer provided a typed account of his personal and professional background which contained very sparse and incomplete information about himself and his career. More specifically, he responded to most questions with phrases with one-word answers. On the other hand, Mr. Bayer demonstrated the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. This  has the ability to produce professional and informative reports and documentation, but may need some reminders to be more mindful of details and thoroughness. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Bayer to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his occupational accomplishments to date and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. This mechanically-inclined individual was admittedly not a stellar student during his high school years at Lincoln-Way East High School, as he devoted most of his time to his part-time job and outside of school activities. Although he is certainly capable of succeeding with college level coursework, Mr. Bayer has not furthered his formal education beyond high school. As noted in  of this report, Mr. Bayer may need some e2 80 9cexternal motivation e2 80 9d to continually better himself in this career as he reportedly would like to advance to a first-line supervisory role eventually. All things considered, Mr. Bayer has already demonstrated the ability to master the essential information and skills required for the position question, and he also has the potential to obtain advanced fire service certifications once motivated to do so.  Mr. Bayer is the oldest of three children who spent most of his developmental years in suburban Mokena where he attended local public schools. According to Mr. Bayer, he has never met his biological father, and refers to his stepdad as his e2 80 9cfather e2 80 9d while having many positive things to say about him. Nevertheless, this individual still seems to harbor some underlying resentment toward his biological father e2 80 99s abandonment of him, which may be reflected in his overall posture toward those in positions of authority over him in terms of trust and acceptance. Mr. Bayer has applied himself in a fairly determined and focused manner since opting to pursue a fire service career back in 2009 when he signed on with the Mokena FD as a volunteer / paid-on-call recruit. Probably the highlight of his career thus far has been his affiliation with the Country Club Hills Fire Department where he feels he has developed a solid reputation for himself and believes he is viewed by his superiors as a capable and competent fire-medic. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Bayer to be an acceptable  for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a career firefighter. After serving with the CCHFD for over five years now, this  was unmistakably excited about the prospect of joining the full-time ranks within a department he very much respects and enjoys. Rather than talking about opportunities for advancement and development in the coming years, this individual was more focused on the security, stability, and benefits of a career position which has eluded him in all of his years of testing for full-time positions. While we understand this practical and important need on his part, Mr. Bayer may need some reminders about keeping up to speed with the ever-changing face of the fire service these days, and to continually seek out new opportunities to improve himself. From our perspective, Mr. Bayer is likely to be a e2 80 9ccareer blue-shirt e2 80 9d on the basis of his previous activity and accomplishments thus far in his chosen career. On his behalf, he will be a good career blue-shirt, but may get complacent at times. In light of our review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Bayer be given an offer to work as a full-time Firefighter for the City of Country Club Hills, Illinois. \"',\n",

Name: Joseph Biallas Position: Firefighter Intern Age: 21 Department: Fire Department Date: September 9, 2019     : Struggled with the instructions for the online testing process, and did not listen carefully to testing instructions while at our office We attribute this behavior to the  e2 80 99s anxiousness about the assessment process At 21 years of age he has never having experienced anything like this in past hiring procedures Clean-cut and neatly grooomed and attired for his appointment at our office  y  : Extraverted personality profile Anticipates enjoying the camaraderie of the fire service Sees the firehouse as promoting a family-like atmosphere, and as an only child, this part of the job will fulfill a strong need on his part to be involved with a group of people Because of his lack of siblings as a youngster, this individual is used to having things his own way In this regard, we observed the  to be a little self-absorbed Able to hold his own in an argument or dispute    : Lists helping people as his primary attraction to the position in question For example, he believes in providing quality care to the members of the community Compelled to work in the fire service and EMS;

claims he acted in a relatively calm and composed fashion    : Raised with a healthy set of values, to include respect for others and being responsible for one e2 80 99s actions As an eighth grader, candidate was detained at a Six Flags Great America for stealing a pair of sunglasses; his father made him work-off the $200 fine by having the candidate accompany him to work each morning at 5:00 a.m. Reports never having been arrested Admits that he has used marijuana on a handful of occasions, with his last reported usage being during high school Overall, this  can be counted on to hold himself accountable for his behavior    : At present this person has a good support network of family and friends Still living at home with his parents as he is still enrolled in college Currently dating a young woman who is studying nursing while attending WIU Parents are paying for his entire college education; has no mortgage or car payment, or any other major financial obligations at this time Relies on a number of activities to help him reduce any tension and stress in his life Engages in physically demanding activities such as weightlifting, hiking, biking, and swimming to help cope with stress and stay in shape; also has a passion for playing Marvel Superhero video games Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Occasional warning about socializing too much with his fellow employees, especially when chores need to be completed around the station From the candidate e2 80 99s perspective, he could listen better and take constructive criticism without reacting harshly Clear-cut goals and expectations for his job performance        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s online materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Biallas did a fairly good job of providing accurate and detailed information on his Personal History Form. On the other hand, Mr. Biallas offered little valuable information when asked to describe both a highlight and a setback during the course of his career. We attribute the  e2 80 99s less than desired handling of this part of the assessment process to his own admission that at age 21, he has not had much of a career to date. As can be seen from a review of his performance on the  this person knows how to express himself when communicating with others. As mentioned in  of this report, Mr. Biallas is still attending college at Western Illinois University, where he expects to receive his B.S. degree in fire science during May of next year. Regardless, we believe that Mr. Biallas possesses the proper thinking skills required in order to both learn and perform the essential elements of the job in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Biallas to be an acceptable  for the position in question. The Algonquin-Lake in the Hills Fire Protection District is familiar with this individual, as Mr. Biallas selected the department as the location for his internship in connection with his fire science degree at Western Illinois University. As we noted, this person has thus far prepared himself appropriately to begin his career in the fire service and EMS. Still a work-in-progress, but from what he has displayed to date, he is well on his way to becoming an asset to any fire department which seeks to employ him. Mr. Biallas was raised with healthy respect for following the rules and respecting other people, especially those in positions of authority. When Mr. Biallas was caught shoplifting sunglasses from Six Flags Great America when he was quite young, his father administered discipline in a manner befitting a young man needing to learn a lesson by making his son accompany him to work at 5:00AM each day. Raised as an only child, the camaraderie of the firehouse is a primary attraction for the  to this line of work. Mr. Biallas spoke of his desire to help people in need and becoming a firefighter/paramedic fulfills both of those goals and needs. Therefore, in light of our overall, favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Biallas be given an offer to join the program as a Firefighter Intern for the Algonquin-Lake in the Hills Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

in fact, in both instances the agreement for him to leave his job was mutual The  has exercised good judgment outside of work by never having been arrested or used any type of illegal drugs At present, this person resides at home with his parents Recently ended a year and a half relationship; the candidate complained that his girlfriend e2 80 9ctried to change him e2 80 9d    : The prognosis for this person having to resign, yet again, from another fire department is rather high due to his inability to handle the EMS portion of the position The  e2 80 99s low self-esteem and feelings of self-consciousness contribute to his anxieties, which in turn, cause the candidate to struggle under the pressure of EMS calls Has successfully battled a life-threatening illness that was discovered during a routine medical check for the fire service From a personal perspective, he has toughness and grit and been resilient in the face of adversity His hobbies include brewing beer with his father He also works out regualrly as he is studying to become personal trainer Special Training, Orientation & Concerns This candidate e2 80 99s shortcomings are inherent to his personality and cannot be easily mitigated by training.        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Bjorklund submitted a Personal History Form that was reasonably accurate with some missing information, such as his time with the New Lenox Fire Department. Despite lacking sufficient detail, the spelling and grammar were correct. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the  e2 80 99s career. The  demonstrated acceptable writing ability, but again, Mr. Bjorklund was short on the details, while paying attention to using the appropriate grammar and syntax. These deficiencies in the  e2 80 99s attention to detail are consistent with our earlier observations about how he has a problem in deliberating carefully. Our sense is that Mr. Bjorklund just wants to get mundane tasks, like paperwork and report writing, done as quickly as possible. On the other hand, there is no question that Mr. Bjorklund is bright as evidenced by his strong showing on the . All things considered, the candidate has the ability to learn and master the essential information and technical skills required to perform the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Bjorklund to be a less than acceptable  for the position in question. We base our decision on his past problems in handling the pressure and stress of staying composed during EMS calls and the anxiousness that we witnessed in our assessment of the . According to the candidate, he himself knows when he is feeling overwhelmed and has agreed with his superior officers that it would be in the best interests of all parties if Mr. Bjorklund resigned from the departments. In his own words, Mr. Bjorklund is worried how his fellow fire medics are viewing his actions and responses to emergency situations. Not wanting to hurt patients, Mr. Bjorklund freezes. This unfortunate situation has occurred on two occasions in New Lenox in 2016 and more recently in Roselle in 2018. These problems are accentuated due to the candidate e2 80 99s self-conscious attitude along with his observed low sense of self-esteem. This is very unfortunate since Mr. Bjorklund is a likeable individual. We admire his openness and honesty in discussing his shortcomings. We also admire his courage in overcoming a frightening and potentially life-threatening medical situation, which appears to have been satisfactorily resolved according to the  e2 80 99s attending physicians. Nevertheless, in light of our stated concerns and reservations, we would not recommend that Mr. Bjorklund be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Hazel Crest. \"',\n",

words flowing in a less than fluid fashion Although she is smaller in physical stature, she is able to project a credible police presence  y  : Engaging and energetic manner Despite her dislike of

Earned a B.A. degree in criminal justice from Buena Vista University in 2012 Performed an internship with the juvenile court in Buena Vista, Iowa, in connection with her degree program Spent over a

Lansing Police Department in March of 2017 Successfully completed the police training academy offered through the Illinois State Police in 2017   : Likes to keep active and busy as evidenced by her dissatisfaction with slow periods on her shifts with Lansing Police Department Will keep herself occupied during slow periods by monitoring traffic, checking premises along with getting outside of her cruiser and talking to people States that her productivity thus far has been e2 80 9cpretty good, e2 80 9d adding that she has not been sat down and talked to by her supervisors or FTO e2 80 99s Currently on probation with the Lansing Police Department until March of 2018 Based on her limited writing sample, she might be less invested in completing paperwork and reporting forms    : Prefers to report to a hands-on, helpful supervisor Especially appreciates a leader who will jump right in when things get busy on the street Also appreciates fairness and consistency from her superior officers While able to tolerate strict, paramilitary discipline -- like she received during her training at the police training academy offered through the Illinois State Police -- it is not her preferred style of leadership Reports no terminations or disciplinary actions taken against her while employed at any police agency  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : While quiet and soft-spoken in social settings, and especially in front of large groups of people, she is capable of being appropriately assertive in enforcement situations Will not shirk her responsibilities for such routine activities as traffic enforcement Fully comprehends the danger involved in situations like domestic disputes where things can e2 80 9cturn bad e2 80 9d in an instant Tries to approach

Resilient and determined in achieving goals which she has set for herself Has a good support group of family members to rely on when feeling troubled Does not engage in any destructive behaviors that would impair her job performance For example, since leaving college the candidate rarely consumes alcohol Also relaxes by watching movies and working out on a fairly regular basis  Close monitoring of her paperwork and reports to make sure that they contain sufficient detail and information Possibly assigning to schools once she is acclimated to her new role in order to help her develop confidence in her group speaking abilities   Below Average Average Above Average Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Apprai Test (assesses logical reasoning skills & ability to make critical evaluations of arguments & assumptions) Norms for Police Officers BELOW AVERAGE BELOW AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, her handwriting was reasonably neat and legible. We administered two writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On both of her exercises, this  demonstrated marginally acceptable writing ability. In particular, the candidate was not at all attentive to the critical details, even though she wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, and used proper grammar and syntax. Ms. Bogan e2 80 99s lack of attention to the details is concerning in that police reports are a matter of public record and can be used in a court of law. Any flaws in her paperwork and report writing could reflect badly on the department. As noted above, Ms. Bogan performed lower than average on all of our standardized testing tools, which means that she might take longer to learn the finer points of her new job. On the other hand, she has successfully completed the police training academy in connection with her current job with the Lansing Police Department. This leads us to believe that Ms. Bogan can master the essential elements of her new role.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Bogan to be an acceptable  for the position in question. According to the candidate, she became interested in law enforcement after taking criminal justice classes during college. She has stuck with her career aspirations to become a police officer by pursuing an auxiliary position and also working with juveniles in a detention setting. At present, she is about to complete her probationary period with the Lansing Police Department. The candidate claims that she wants to change departments because of her employer e2 80 99s residency requirement, which makes it a condition of employment that she live in town. We commend this  for having overcome a stuttering defect to be able to perform her job in an acceptable fashion. Still, she struggles with her self-confidence when asked to participate in group settings, like classrooms or large meetings, and be responsible for contributing to the discussion. Perhaps, when she is experienced in her role, she might be asked to work in the public schools, where she can overcome some of her shyness in front of groups. However, there is nothing unassertive or meek about the  e2 80 99s ability to enforce the law. She will be more than capable of administering this portion of her job. We did detect, nonetheless, a tendency to give short shrift to paperwork and report writing, which is an area that will require addressing. Nevertheless, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Ms. Bogan be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Hazel Crest. \"',\n",

While we expect him to catch on rather quickly, a bit of support and encouragement may go a long way with this individual during his field training and probationary period. Candidate is admittedly very hard on himself after mistakes; his own worst critic. Will need to learn from mistakes, incorporate constructive criticism, and move on without dwelling on them.        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Bolin provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background which was thorough and appropriately detailed. We also administered two other writing samples, which included a mock police report as well as a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the  e2 80 99s career. On both of these exercises, this  demonstrated acceptable writing ability as he was able to demonstrate his ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar and punctuation. With a bit of training and oversight, this individual should not have difficulty producing informative and professional reports and documentation. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Bolin to possess above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his outstanding grades during high school and college, and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. Mr. Bolin graduated from Hersey High School in 2015 with a reported 4.40 (5.00 scale). Although he was not involved in any extracurricular activities, this individual worked part-time his final two years. According to Mr. Bolin, he was uncertain of his career plans upon entering Illinois State University where he went on to earn his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in accounting and graduating summa cum laude with a 4.90 (5.00 scale) GPA. Although he is very light on law enforcement exposure, this bright and determined young man should be able to master the essential information and skills required to become a police officer.  Mr. Bolin has a twin brother, and he is technically the second oldest of three children who was born, raised, and continues to reside in Arlington Heights where he attended local public schools. An outstanding student throughout high school and college, Mr. Bolin stated that he was interested in police work during his developmental years. Stating that even though he envisioned himself someday working as a police officer, he earned a bachelor e2 80 99s degree in accounting, e2 80 9cjust in case a law enforcement career didn e2 80 99t work out e2 80 9d for him. From all indications, this hardworking and achievement oriented individual applied himself diligently to graduate with distinction in college, while also being president of the club volleyball team at ISU. Other than refereeing handball and youth sports, this individual has virtually no exposure to police operations e2 80 93 not even a ride-along. At the same time, Mr. Bolin appeared to possess a somewhat realistic perception of what awaits him as a police officer in terms of essential job functions. He has been applying to selected suburban police departments since he graduated a few months ago. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Bolin to be a reasonably acceptable  for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all but one of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. While he may be a rather undistinguished candidate in terms of his preparation for the job, we like his character, work ethic, integrity, and emerging sense of self-confidence and maturity. A somewhat young , our assessment indicates that Mr. Bolin possesses the potential to master essential job functions with a bit of patience and encouragement on the part of his immediate supervisors and field training officers. Along this line, Mr. Bolin will need to be able to establish more of an authoritative bearing in certain situations, which we anticipate will evolve with maturity, experience, and training. In light of our review of his intelligence and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Bolin be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Schaumburg, Illinois. \"',\n",

he enjoys weightlifting and running Small but supportive base of family Demonstrated ability to cope with the negativity and resistance encountered on the streets in an adaptive manner Possesses one potentially harmful habit that would impair his performance on the job In particular, this person drinks socially upwards to six beers, or two to three cocktails, as many as several times a month Due in part to his large size, this may not be an issue, but his alcohol consumption does approach the levels of binge drinking  Caution about his afterhours alcohol consumption as it could lead to an embarrassing and possible career ending DUI Should familiarize himself with de-escalation techniques that are more applicable to the service calls experienced by officers in the City of Palos Hills Place focus on emphasizing the importance of calling for backup, including the timing of it considering that he may overestimate his own skills and abilities at this time especially in novel situations        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Brody was conscientious about the testing process, followed instructions well, and worked within expressed timelines. He submitted a Personal History form that was accurate and had sufficient detail with minor mistakes. Meanwhile, his spelling and grammar were acceptable. In addition, we also administered two other writing samples which included a mock police report as well as a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the  e2 80 99s career. On both exercises, this  demonstrated acceptable writing ability, appropriate grammar and syntax, and most pertinent details. His  as scored by the  are not surprising considering his level of education. All things considered, the candidate has the ability to master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate has demonstrated good EQ by understanding how his actions may have been perceived by others and how some of his decisions, specifically being fired from his job many years ago as a plumber, affected those close to him.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Brody to be an acceptable  for the position in question. Mr. Brody is aware that he projects a credible police presence due to his stature and previous experience, and he is coming into the job for reasons that align well with this line of work, such as being community focused without sacrificing authority. His biggest setback, which included termination from a union plumbing job in 2008, reflects his ability to turn such a situation around as he learned and developed from this experience. In short, it shows his ability to face adversity and proceed toward his future goals. From then on, his career began an upward trajectory. Today, he works for the Cook County Sherriff e2 80 99s Department as a Correctional Officer, and he has been doing so for the past six years. Such experience as his provides a solid foundation for a role of a police officer. Although he has a small social support network, he reports having a solid foundation, especially at home provided by his wife, who is supportive of him and of his line of work. As our report indicates, he is a genuine, self-aware, and dedicated individual looking to grow and develop in his career as a police officer. While we recommend this person, we suggest the department place focus on emphasizing the importance of calling for backup, including the timing of it considering that Mr. Brody may overestimate his own skills and abilities especially in novel situations. Regardless, in light of our overall, favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Brody be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Palos Hills. /\"',\n",

Name: Amanda Bronge Position: Police Officer Age: 21 Department: Police Department Date: May 14, 2018     : The first thing people will notice about this individual is her diminutive physical stature and her youthful appearance Neatly groomed and attired in slacks and a blouse; professional and congenial presentation Came across as upbeat, engaging, mature, and confident Candid and well-spoken; honest and straightforward Despite her relatively young age and e2 80 9cgirlish e2 80 9d appearance, this  has the capacity to present herself in an approachable, credible, and capable manner  y  : Outgoing and amiable individual who can best be described as positive and e2 80 9cbubbly e2 80 9d Background in competitive sports and various work groups;

serious about her duties and responsibilities Expected to go above and beyond that which is merely required of her in terms of performance evaluations    : Positive relationships with nearly all of the authority figures in her life beginning with her parents, coaches, and previous bosses Catches on quickly and follows the rules; will adhere to departmental policies and procedures Respectful and accommodating in her interactions with her superiors Will strive to earn their respect and trust through her effort and competence on the job Open and receptive to constructive criticism;

will rely on persuasiveness and diplomacy in the face of resistance We were also impressed with her situational awareness; very observant With the proper training and further experience we believe this area will emerge as a strength for this individual    : Open and candid in discussing some of the regrets and disappointments she has had in her life thus far Able to acknowledge her own contribution to problems and setbacks when they occurred From all indications, this candidate began assuming responsibility for herself and her actions at an early age It is rare that we rate individuals her age as e2 80 9cstrong e2 80 9d on this dimension; however, this  came across as an independent, self-sufficient, and responsible adult No brushes with law enforcement; tried marijuana about five times her senior year of high school    : Very driven individual with high needs for achievement and competence; may tend to over-commit herself at times Seems to enjoy operating under pressure and has demonstrated her ability to cope with difficulties, obstacles, and frustration on and off the job in an adaptive manner Stable, level-headed, and relatively well-adjusted Not prone toward prolonged periods of worry or depression, but does function with a good deal of nervous energy Supportive base of family and friends Enjoys a few social and recreational outlets which help her to relax and blow off steam when necessary  We do not anticipate any significant difficulties regarding this candidate e2 80 99s ability to perform essential job functions after she has been properly trained and oriented to the District. If anything, we would advise that it may be easy to underestimate this young  e2 80 99s capabilities based upon her appearance and limited life experience.   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Bronge provided a neatly typed account of her personal and professional life that included essential details and a degree of elaboration whenever it was necessary. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this  demonstrated above average writing ability, as she consistently expressed herself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Report writing and documentation should not prove to be problematic for this articulate young . Overall, we evaluate Ms. Bronge to possess above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by her outstanding grades throughout high school and college, and by her scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above. Ms. Bronge graduated from Marengo Community High School in 2014 with a remarkable 3.90 GPA. During her high school years she participated in cheerleading, softball, student council, and she also worked part-time. Stating that she wanted a career that involved service to others, Ms. Bronge set off for the University of Wisconsin at Osh Kosh where she was awarded her bachelor e2 80 99s degree with a double major in psychology and criminal justice, graduating with a strong 3.50 GPA. All things considered, this bright, determined, and diligent individual will not have difficulty mastering the essential information and skills required of a conservation police officer.  The younger of two children, Ms. Bronge spent her developmental years in Marengo where she attended local public schools. According to Ms. Bronge, she was involved in cheerleading since the age of four, which in part may account for her cheerful, energetic, and enthusiastic approach to life and her vocational objectives. Without sounding overly confident, Ms. Bronge stated during her interview that she has always been a e2 80 9cweird combination of girly-girl and tomboy e2 80 9d throughout her life, which we believe is an accurate depiction of the range of her interests and interpersonal style. Along this line, we believe she is a much tougher cookie than her size and age might suggest as evidenced by her accomplishments, achievements, and ability to deal with some stressful situations in her life. Most importantly, Ms. Bronge is a compassionate and sincere individual who is able to balance her empathy for others with standing up for e2 80 9cwhat is right e2 80 9d and established laws and rules. We believe her coworkers will find her to be engaging, down-to-earth, and highly motivated to earn their respect and trust. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Bronge to be a strong candidate for the position in question as she received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. It is not often that we rate 21-year-old candidates as e2 80 9cstrong e2 80 9d in our evaluation of their respective attributes related to success in police work, but Ms. Bronge is an exception. It would be easy to underestimate this relative young individual e2 80 99s maturity, work ethic, perseverance, resilience, and social adeptness based upon her initial impression. Not only has this bright and confident individual had some relevant experience in enforcement activities, we found her to be a likable and highly motivated individual who should prove to be a pleasure to supervise. In light of our favorable review of her qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Ms. Bronge be extended an offer of employment to serve as a Police Officer with the McHenry County Conservation District. \"',\n",

On the other hand, Mr. Budzban left out a number of important details including much of his employment history, choosing instead, to list only information about his present position with Superior Ambulance. On a written exercise asking the candidate to describe a highlight and a setback in his career, Mr. Budzban e2 80 99s written responses were not terribly elaborate. The  e2 80 99s inability to offer relevant details and information is a developmental need for Mr. Budzban as he will be required to compile paperwork and written reports for the EMS piece of the position in question. In particular, he will have to submit accurate reports for services rendered in order for the department to be properly reimbursed. On another matter, we have already mentioned in  of this report that Mr. Budzban strikes us as gifted with empathy, which is a key ingredient in measuring the level of a person e2 80 99s emotional intelligence. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Budzban to possess the proper thinking skills as they pertain to the position in question, which is also reinforced by his above-reported test results.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Budzban to be an acceptable  for the position in question. According to the candidate, he enrolled in college at Roosevelt University immediately after graduating from Palatine High School in 2004. However, the candidate characterized himself as someone who has never been a e2 80 9cschool person. e2 80 9d As a result, he dropped out of college and went to work in a retail store, Staples, selling office-related products. This job lasted for about eight years. Toward the end of his time at the store, Mr. Budzban began to realize that the job was a dead end in terms of a career. In the meantime, a battalion chief from the Palatine Fire Department convinced the candidate to explore his options in the fire service and EMS. Toward that end, Mr. Budzban enrolled in classes at Harper College, also in Palatine, Illinois, and he earned his EMT-B certification in 2012. He continued to acquire more credentials meant to bolster a budding career in the fire service and EMS. As mentioned in  of this report, Mr. Budzban has gained valuable experience working for Superior Ambulance, and as a paid-on-call firefighter/paramedic in Winthrop Harbor. We have very few reservations about this individual other than needing to ensure the completeness of his report writing and paperwork pertaining to the job. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Budzban be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Countryside Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

On the other hand, she did not elaborate to any large degree on this same document. We also administered two other writing samples, both of which were typed. On both of the exercises, Ms. Buhlman demonstrated acceptable writing ability. This finding was not surprising given her educational accomplishments and mastery level performance on our test of cognitive abilities shown above. In analyzing her written communication skills, the candidate was generally attentive to most of the important details. Moreover, Ms. Buhlman wrote in clear and complete sentences while making proper use of grammar and syntax. Therefore, we do not anticipate that the  will experience problems with paperwork and report writing demands required of police work. Overall, we evaluate this individual to be quite bright, and expect that she would be able to effectively learn the essential elements of the job. Although, due to some of her personality characteristics we have documented throughout this report, she may have difficulty executing certain duties or tasks required by the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Buhlman to be a less than acceptable  for the position in question. There is little doubt that this person is well-intended and sincere in her desire to help others. She has given her time to volunteer organizations, like Habitat for Humanity. On the other hand, she is looking for excitement and challenge in her work. In her behalf, Ms. Buhlman has taken steps to prepare herself academically to become a police officer. She has both an undergraduate and graduate degree in criminal justice. However, her practical work experience has been mostly in food service industry jobs. On her behalf, these have given her some customer service experience working with the general public. Yet in her most recent position as a delivery driver, Ms. Buhlman has been able to work alone for the most part, and avoids the sometimes chaotic nature of the restaurant with its masses of people. The  acknowledges it has been a continuous challenge for her to emerge from her shell as an introvert to be able to interact comfortably with other people. As a police officer, one will have a great deal of interaction with the community and members of the public. Ms. Buhlman is lacking in this skill. She is also rather unassertive, and the enforcement piece of the position will be a struggle for her. Finally, as an individual who prefers to proceed slowly and take her time, she will become flustered with the multi-tasking required of her in the cruiser while on patrol. Therefore, in light of our stated concerns and reservations, we would not recommend that Ms. Buhlman be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Zion. \"',\n",

grandfather was a police officer in Streamwood, Illinois, while his uncle is a retired Streamwood firefighter Helping people is his primary motivation for seeking the job in question This individual wants to make a positive impact on the lives of other people At the same time, he is hoping to work in a profession that offers variety and excitement In short, he wants to avoid being behind a desk from 9-to-5  relevant work and life experience  : Earned his A.A.S. degree in criminal justice from Elgin in 2011 Although he was hired by the Cook County Department of Corrections, he left their training academy after two days stating that he did not want to work in corrections While he has no other direct exposure to law enforcement, this person was in the position of a supervisor for three years with Jewel-Osco where he was responsible for overseeing the work of other employees at his store location On the other hand, the  acknowledged that he encountered few cases requiring any kind of disciplinary action   : This individual has an outstanding track record for employment stability He was employed by Jewel-Osco for ten years, starting immediately after graduating from high school To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he began at the bottom, stocking shelves and eventually moving into the above-mentioned role of a supervisor At the UPS Store, where the  left in nuary of this year, he remained with that company for two and a half years This person will be seen as a dedicated and loyal employee who rarely, if ever, complains about his work    : As implied, this person was raised with a healthy respect for those in positions of authority At no time has he ever been arrested or used illegal substances At work, he has never been terminated from any previous place of work, nor has he ever been on the receiving end of any disciplinary actions This person is sensitive to being treated fairly as he expects his superiors to be supportive of him and the others on his shift For the candidate, fairness constitutes being rewarded -- both formally and informally -- for working hard  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Largely because of his inexperience we think that the  will require extra coaching and guidance in handling difficult encounters, such as domestic disputes As stated previously in this report, this person has had very limited exposure to enforcing rules and regulations, even when he was employed as a supervisor for Jewel-Osco At the same time, he can be expected to show good manners and respect the members of the community who he stops for routine violations We also believe that the candidate is capable of acting courageously when asked to provide reliable and prompt back-up for his fellow officers    : The  is not inclined to make excuses for his performance For example, he was extremely forthcoming about his past disappointments, to include his two-day stay at the corrections academy for Cook County In short, he will hold himself accountable for his actions On a social level, this person strikes us as not fully developed More specifically, he lives at home with two of his three brothers Furthermore, he has never been involved in any kind of serious relationship    : After the embarrassment of leaving the corrections academy for Cook County, we doubt that this person will want to repeat the experience As such, we believe he will remain if he is offered the job in question This person has no serious outside distractions as he has managed his finances carefully and acted in a fiscally responsible fashion Also has healthy outlets, like sports, where he plays ice hockey on a regular basis In addition, he plays videogames for diversion when he has the time Finally, with several members of his family who have served in public safety roles, this person has a ready-made source of support away from the job  Coaching and guidance on how to handle potentially dangerous and difficult encounters, such as those experienced on the street or during domestic disputes Careful monitoring of his paperwork and report writing, especially when he pressed for time to produce a finished product Might require patience in learning his job as he probably takes a little longer to master the subtleties of a new role   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Burke provided accurate and complete information. We appreciated the way that Mr. Burke elaborated on his answers, and we suspect Mr. Burke is less shy and reserved on paper than when speaking in public. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On these exercises, Mr. Burke failed to demonstrate acceptable writing ability. All of the excellent qualities we observed with regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted were missing in his mock police report. We are not sure how to explain such a discrepancy other than the mock report was timed, while Mr. Burke e2 80 99s on-line materials were untimed. In short, being rushed might prove problematic for him. Regardless, his superiors might want to monitor Mr. Burke e2 80 99s paperwork and report writing when he is under time pressures to produce a final product. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Burke to be bright enough to handle the mental demands of the position in question. His lower performance on the  probably predicts for a person who needs to take his time to master the subtleties of the job.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Burke to be an acceptable  for the position in question. There is a lot to like about this individual. Raised to respect everyone, regardless of their station, his fellow officers will experience Mr. Burke as pleasant and polite in addition to being courteous and respectful. This candidate is down-to-earth and open as well as honest. Mr. Burke did not attempt to hide his setbacks, including his embarrassing two-day stay with the Cook County Department of Corrections. We believe that municipal policing is more in line with this person e2 80 99s aptitudes and interests. Furthermore, Mr. Burke has an uncle and grandfather who worked in public safety on the fire side and in law enforcement, respectively. Mr. Burke also boasts an excellent work record. Although his track record for employment stability is impressive, he is still relatively inexperienced in enforcement situations. We do not doubt the candidate e2 80 99s courage when called into action. On the other hand, he still has a lot to learn. Finally, we think that when asked to produce paperwork and reports under pressure, Mr. Burke might struggle. Hence individualized coaching is recommended to remedy these observed deficiencies. Therefore, in light of our overall, favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Burke be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Bartlett. \"',\n",

Mr. Butler received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a firefighter. We had an opportunity to evaluate Mr. Butler for a firefighter position in Country Club Hills earlier this year and found him to be an acceptable candidate for the job. However, shortly after he was hired by the Country Club Hills Fire Department in August of this year, he was asked to resign from the department approximately one month later. According to the candidate, an anonymous person in the Country Club Hills Fire Department threatened to sue both the Department and the Village because Mr. Butler had not gone through the proper steps to get hired by the Department. In particular, Mr. Butler had not taken the entry-level written test for the Country Club Hills Fire Department. When it was discovered that Mr. Butler had indeed not taken the written examination even though he successfully completed his polygraph examination along with his psychological examination, he was asked to resign his position with Country Club Hills. So, in September of this year, exactly one month to the date of his hiring, Mr. Butter was asked to tender his resignation to the Country Club Hills Fire Department. While this incident technically counts as a termination, the situation was not the fault of the . For his part, Mr. Butler believed that he had done everything correctly and followed the proper protocol.

living with active males is not something that will require him to make adjustments    : With above average needs for variety and excitement, the activity level in the fire service is very alluring to this person According to the candidate, the job is e2 80 9cnever boring, e2 80 9d and we might add, not behind a desk either The physical and mental challenges of the work are important draws for this individual Of course, the camaraderie associated with the close confines of the fire service also has its appeal to the  In sum, he wants to feel rewarded at the end of a shift, as well as satisfied with his career when it comes time to retire    : EMT-B from Moraine Valley Community College which was awarded in 2016 B.O.F. in 2016 through his affiliation with the Garden Homes Fire Protection District Paramedic e2 80 99s license received in 2018 through South Suburban College and Ingalls Hospital A.A.S. degree in EMS from Moraine Valley Community College, earned in 2019 Spent three and a half years as a volunteer firefighter/EMT with the Garden Homes Fire Protection District Currently serving the Central Stickney Fire Protection District, since March of 2018, and the Crestwood Fire Department, since July of 2018   : Committed fire medic who reports working as many as 72 hours a week Likes to keep active and busy Prides himself on his punctuality Willing to train at any time Rates relatively high on our measures of conscientiousness On the other hand, this individual did a two-week suspension at the Central Stickney Fire Protection District for damaging a vehicle when he carelessly hit a bay door    : Raised in a religious household to respect those in positions of authority from parents to teachers and priests Will keep quiet when angry or frustrated and will not voluntarily voice his views and opinions Responds well to a humble, hands-on supervisor Respects leadership-by-example While the  appreciates an approachable supervisor, he also understands that he or she has to be firm with their assigned shift    : Has had decent exposure to emergencies and trauma, to include serious motorcycle accidents This individual also deals with a fair number of fatal cardiac arrests, especially in his capacity as a firefighter/paramedic with the Crestwood Fire Department as the Village has a sizeable number of nursing homes The  acknowledges that he prepares himself for such situations by expecting to see the worst Regardless, he stays focused and relies on both his own training and the expertise of his fellow fire medics    : Reports no serious brushes with the law He did, however, have his driving privileges suspended when he failed to attend driving school due to speeding tickets, which would have spared him the problem of losing his license Only tried marijuana on a single occasion during high school Presently resides in an apartment with his fianc c3 a9, who is a NICU Nurse at Advocate Christ Hospital in Oak lawn, Illinois The couple recently became engaged about a month ago    : Has few financial worries as this person manages his money in a mature and responsible manner Is used to e2 80 9cchaotic e2 80 9d living conditions with seven brothers in his family of origin Moreover, with a large family as well as a loyal group of friends, this person has a strong, social support network While the candidate consumed alcohol in larger amounts a few years ago, his heavy work schedule limits his drinking At present, he will have two or three beers at most when out with family or friends To relieve tension and stress this person rides dirt bikes and also enjoys working out Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Encouragement to speak up more often, especially when he is frustrated about a matter Possibly monitoring of his paperwork and report writing as he might show some inconsistencies with respect to his attention to detail        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Cimaglia prepared a comprehensive and complete Personal History Form, which reflected an acceptable attention to detail. On the other hand, Mr. Cimaglia was far less detailed in his approach to handling an exercise asking him to state a highlight and setback during the course of his career. This inconsistent performance is somewhat surprising since Mr. Cimaglia appears to write rather well, and his  score on the  was quite good. We evaluate this individual to possess good judgment for the most part, with only a few observable lapses as uncovered by this report. In particular, his failure to attend classes at traffic school, which would have saved him from losing his driving privileges, demonstrated a poor choice on the  e2 80 99s part. The other occasion when he was less than careful refers to his accident in the garage bay with his vehicle at the Central Stickney Fire Protection District. Overall, however, we evaluate Mr. Cimaglia to be gifted with the proper thinking skills required to learn and master the essential elements of the firefighter/paramedic e2 80 99s job.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Cimaglia to be an acceptable  for the position in question. The  e2 80 99s first exposure to EMS came when he himself was a youngster and the paramedics responded to an emergency call at his home in Evergreen Park, Illinois. At the time, Mr. Cimaglia e2 80 99s youngest brother was seriously ill, which thankfully has been treated successfully. However, it was really after high school that the candidate became committed to a career in the fire service and EMS. As we noted in  of this report, Mr. Cimaglia has made a concerted effort to obtain the proper schooling and experience in order to position himself for a full-time job as a firefighter/paramedic. The amount of effort exerted by Mr. Cimaglia should not be underestimated as the candidate claims that school never came easy for him. As one of eight brothers, several of his siblings have been very successful students in school, graduating college to become engineers. For Mr. Cimaglia, school was never easy or much fun for that matter, but to the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he persevered even after failing the state EMT exam on his first attempt. We like the  e2 80 99s overall work ethic and positive attitude. We see him as a dutiful performer who will fit in well with his fellow firefighter/paramedics, having lived in close quarters with his seven brothers throughout his childhood. Therefore, in light of our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Cimaglia be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Matteson. \"',\n",

shows initiative Eager to prove himself to his coworkers and supervisors and will strive to meet or exceed performance standards As noted above, this candidate can be competitive Will approach duties and assignments with vigor and a positive attitude At the same time, the candidate has been criticized for being e2 80 9chyper e2 80 9d and as a result, he needs to slow down For example, he can miss certain details when making rig checks    : Has had positive relationships with most authority figures in his life beginning with his parents and stepfather Expected to adhere to departmental policies and procedures Reports no write-ups or disciplinary actions taken against him with the Grayslake Fire Protection District Will be respectful and accommodating in his interactions with his superiors Likely to enjoy life within a paramilitary organization Reasonably open-minded; will strive to make good use of constructive criticism    : States that he knew ahead of time what he was getting into, so the more gruesome and disturbing parts of the job have been easier for him to handle Comes across as confident and assertive On the other hand, we sense that this individual can be a bit excitable under pressure Expected to utilize common sense and practical judgment in most situations Is expected to improve over time with the proper training and guidance    : Was very open and candid in talking about some of the regrets and disappointments he has had in his relatively young life Honest and straightforward Expected to hold himself accountable for his actions on and off the job Smoked marijuana twice during his early high school years Revealed an incident in which he was charged with battery and destruction of property while engaged in a fight at a party in July of 2015; all charges were dismissed Resides with parents after living independently for a while; reports having no girlfriend at the present time    : Is a stable and relatively well-adjusted young man with a solid support base of family and several close friends Both his father and stepfather are both career firefighters, and he will utilize them to talk things out if he becomes stressed or frustrated on the job Should be able to cope with the more traumatic and gruesome aspects of life in the fire service as he has a positive self-image Spends a lot of time in the gym working out, and as noted previously in our report, this person blows of steam through mixed martial arts competitions Alcohol consumption is minimal Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Supervisors need to caution the candidate to slow down as we believe he can be overly enthusiastic and excitable at times in his desire to prove himself Along the same line, we also anticipate that he can be rather hard on himself after mistakes or disappointing his supervisors Finally from his own perspective, this person needs to improve on his patience        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Cloe submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate and provided an excellent amount of information and detail. Also on his Personal History Form, the  adhered to the proper rules of spelling and grammar. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the  e2 80 99s career. The  demonstrated acceptable writing ability, and in particular, Mr. Cloe offered a great deal of pertinent details. Once again, Mr. Cloe made use of appropriate grammar and syntax. Although his writing ability is more than passable, it was our sense that this individual tends to rush through more sedentary and mundane tasks such as report writing and documentation. While he is capable of producing informative and useful reports, he may need some reminders about their importance by his superiors. Finally, we are impressed by his performance on the , and all things considered, the candidate has the ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Cloe to be an acceptable  for the position in question. According to the candidate, he has had a lifelong interest in the fire service and EMS. His biological father is the current Fire Chief in Libertyville, Illinois. His stepfather also has an involvement in the fire service. Meanwhile, his mother is an ER nurse at the Condell Medical Center also located in Libertyville. The  noted that during his paramedic training he worked alongside his mother in the ER at the Condell Medical Center. There is no question that Mr. Cloe was literally raised in the fire house for some portion of his youth. While his current department is aware of the incident, Mr. Cloe was involved in a fight in July of 2015. During the altercation, the other party was injured, with Mr. Cloe breaking the other person e2 80 99s arm. The candidate claims that his actions were all in self-defense and that he did nothing to provoke the altercation. All charges were dropped, but regardless, the incident points to a macho, tough-guy image that this person likes to project. We suspect that his smaller physical stature may drive the  e2 80 99s need to prove his physical prowess. Although he is a competitive individual who enjoys wrestling and the martial arts, we do not view this young man as an aggressive individual with an anger management problem. While he seemed to be credible and honest in recounting this incident, we would advise the District to look into this matter further if any questions still exist regarding his temperament. The Grayslake Fire Protection District knows this individual well, having employed him since December of 2017, so they will have additional insight regarding the  e2 80 99s temperament and disposition. With the proper training and some experience under his belt, we believe Mr. Cloe will emerge as a positive addition to the ranks. Therefore, in light of our overall review of his suitability for the job, we would recommend that Mr. Cloe be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Grayslake Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

Name: Joshua Cokefair Position: Firefighter Age: 25 Department: Fire Department Date: November 26, 2019     : Conscientious about the testing process, followed instructions well, and worked within the expressed timelines Punctual and arrived about 50 minutes early for his scheduled appointment Well-groomed personal appearance Appropriately attired in a suit and tie Seemed anxious about the assessment process  y  : Pleasant and polite manner Courteous and respectful towards others Likes to engage people in discussion when he is feeling more comfortable and relaxed On the other hand, because he was anxious about the assessment process, he struggled to articulate his thoughts In short, he seemed tongue-tied in answering some of the questions posed to him during the interview portion of the assessment process Beyond just the stress of the assessment situation, there is evidence that the  is generally anxious, which results in him having low self-esteem Nevertheless, he is a likeable individual    : Comes from a firefighting family; father is currently serving as the Fire Chief in Antioch, Illinois Wants a career where he can help people and solve problems Scored above average on our measures of altruism; should show an active concern for the well-being of others Perhaps, the candidate e2 80 99s most compelling reason for wanting a career in the fire service is for the variety and excitement associated with this line of work In his own words, he e2 80 9cdoes not want to sit behind a desk all day long e2 80 9d In short, he is looking for an occupation in which it does not feel like a job along with a job that he can look forward to each day and take pride in his profession    : EMT-B in 2014 from Vista Health Systems and the College of Lake County B.O.F. in 2016 from NIPSTA in Glenview, Illinois Paramedic e2 80 99s license from Condell Medical Center in 2017 in Libertyville, Illinois Currently serving in the capacity of a lieutenant/paramedic with the Antioch FD, where he has been gainfully employed since May of 2015 Also, earned a B.S. degree in community health from the University of Kansas in May of 2016   : Loyal fire medic committed to a career in the fire service and EMS As noted above, he has been steadily employed with the Antioch FD since May of 2015 In addition, the  has advanced in rank to the role of lieutenant while working at the Antioch FD The only criticism that the candidate has received pertains to his level of self-confidence along with his habit of wanting to do things himself around the firehouse instead of asking others for help Scored well above average on our measure of self-discipline; should be able to motivate himself to see tasks through to completion    : This candidate was raised with a healthy level of respect for those in positions of authority Reports never having been terminated at any previous place of work On the other hand, he was disciplined once with the Antioch FD in 2017 for being part of a crew that had their ambulance become stuck in the mud Prefers a positive and energetic supervisor who is able to lead by example Having a caring and supportive supervisor is also important to this person    : Even though the candidate lacks self-confidence, this is related to his ability to navigate social situations as opposed to his performance during emergencies or trauma Has witnessed a fair amount of trauma and gruesome situations; has been able to adaptively cope with the more stressful and gruesome aspects of life in the fire service thus far Tries to stay focused and in the moment Understands his limits and knows when to defer to the expertise of the more experienced firefighter/paramedics in the department    : The  admits that his e2 80 9cwake-up call e2 80 9d came while a freshman in college when he was arrested for a DUI Unfortunately, for a person with low self-esteem, this event only magnified his feelings that he was a failure In his behalf, however, he took the situation as an opportunity to reevaluate his life and his priorities and to make some adjustments The way the  accepted responsibility for the situation bodes well for taking accountability for his actions Today, he has established himself firmly in a career in the fire service and EMS    : Has a strong support system to help him cope with stress related to his job For example, he has a father in the fire service along with two sisters in the medical field Expected to roll with the punches when faced with adversity and frustration At present, he is single and lives at home Reports no relationships of any significance, yet he has dated a few young women fairly seriously over the past couple of years Nevertheless, he spends most of his free-time with family To relax, this person watches movies and plays video games Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Continued guidance and reassurance to help this person build his level of self-confidence        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Cokefair submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate and contained a sufficient amount of detail and information, while using proper spelling and grammar. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the candidate e2 80 99s career. The  demonstrated acceptable writing ability, and again, made appropriate use of grammar and syntax with only a couple of exceptions. Mr. Cokefair e2 80 99s exercise also contained the pertinent details. The above-reported test scores on the  predict positively for the  e2 80 99s ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe that Mr. Cokefair has demonstrated an acceptable level of emotional intelligence as he is an empathetic person who is able to feel for other people e2 80 99s suffering and pain.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Cokefair to be an acceptable  for the position in question. There is a lot to like about this individual. As noted earlier, the  comes from a background in the fire service as he was often taken to the firehouse by his father when the latter was a member of the Grayslake Fire Protection District. Despite this exposure, Mr. Cokefair was not sure about his choice of a career. The candidate enrolled in college to study community health at the University of Kansas. During his freshman year, he received a wake-up call of sorts, when he was cited for a DUI. Having to turn his life around after disappointing both his family and himself, he set out on a course to join the fire service. As noted in  of this report, Mr. Cokefair has taken steps to earn the necessary certifications and designations required to become a full-time firefighter/paramedic. At present he is a member of the Antioch Fire Department. Mr. Cokefair is progressing nicely in his career thus far. On the other hand, Mr. Cokefair lacks confidence. We see this issue relating to his social development as opposed to his ability to conduct himself capably as a firefighter/paramedic in emergency situations. Regardless, it would be beneficial for this individual to have a better self-image so that he can reduce some of the anxiousness that we observed during the assessment process. Nevertheless, in light of our overall, favorable review of this individual, we would recommend that Mr. Cokefair be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Grayslake Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

drove to our offices instead, and called ahead to relay the information Alert and friendly; presented herself in a congenial manner Wore a nicely tailored business suit; professional presentation Open and honest about her lack of  and experience related to a potential career in law enforcement  y  : Despite having the pastime of competing in bodybuilding bikini competitions, this person is shy and reserved by nature A private and selective individual who prefers to keep to herself until she acclimates to her new environment Her quiet manner should not be confused with disinterest or being antisocial; once this candidate is comfortable with her surroundings, she will be more engaging Polite and considerate; will show courtesy and respect for her fellow officers and the public Over time, we expect this candidate will effectively fit-in at the department    : States that she wants a job that makes a difference in people e2 80 99s lives Toward that end, she made a good case for why she is seeking to change careers from the world of business to public safety After being laid-off at her two most recent corporate jobs, we suspect that she is also searching for a line of work with greater employment stability This individual scored extremely high on our measures of excitement-seeking, which generally predicts for possessing an idealized impression of law enforcement  relevant work and life experience  : B.A. in graphic design from Carthage College in 2005 Did not take any classes in criminal justice or law enforcement Joined a sorority during college but did not perform any leadership roles; was not in a position where she had to enforce rules and regulations Her two jobs over the past ten years were mainly based on graphic design and marketing Within her social and family network, many have jobs in law enforcement; majority of her understanding of police work is from these officers e2 80 99 experiences   : Remained with her two most recent employers for significant lengths of time Both companies experienced a significant reduction in their workforce, otherwise her tenure would likely have been longer From all indications, this person will take her duties and assignments seriously Has been described as diligent by her prior supervisors; not inclined to make many mistakes On the other hand, she admits that she has a tendency to run late for work Has been critiqued for not utilizing her down-time at work effectively; will need reminders to place emphasis on the less stimulating tasks such as reports and paperwork    : Reports never having been terminated from any previous jobs for cause Neither does she report being disciplined by any of her prior employers New to law enforcement, she will be looking to her superiors for assistance and direction Although, she should be open to guidance and advice Sensitive to being supervised too closely or micromanaged Never having worked in a paramilitary setting, the close confines of a law enforcement agency might prove challenging for the candidate Seems well adjusted and willing to learn, yet it is difficult to predict how well she will adapt to her new surroundings  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Expected to be courteous and respectful to citizens Even though she has extensive weightlifting experience, the candidate has no training in defusing volatile situations While she will not intentionally create an officer safety hazard, her lack of experience is cause for serious concern, as she could place herself and others in danger This relatively quiet individual admits to avoiding confrontations with coworkers and others; has a reserved and unassertive nature    : Based on her prior work experience, commitments, and obligations, she is expected to take her responsibilities seriously Open and honest with us about her potential shortcomings for a position in law enforcement, we see the  as holding herself accountable for her actions Does not strike us as prone to making excuses in order to rationalize her behavior With all of this said, we get the sense that the candidate is still unsure about committing to a career, as she is seeking to make a major career shift from the business world to the rough and tumble field of law enforcement    : A totally untested individual, it is difficult to gauge her ability to stick with the job With higher needs for excitement and wanting to make a difference, being assigned to the slower midnight shift for several years as a new officer might not fulfill her expectations It would be particularly beneficial for this candidate to gain some exposure to the field by engaging in a role such as a CSO, auxiliary officer, or working security Although she boasts impressive stays at her previous employers, the stresses inherent in patrolling the streets will have new and profound effects on her Her husband, family, and friends seem to provide her with a good support network To reduce stress and tension, candidate engages in weightlifting and workout routines  This person is sincere and well-intended in many ways, but she is also wholly unprepared for the position in question Although slightly older than the typical community service officer (CSO), as we noted above, she would serve herself and her future agency well by performing in such an auxiliary role   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE  ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Ms. Cosban e2 80 99s handwriting was very neat and legible. We administered two writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On both of her writing exercises, this  demonstrated acceptable writing ability, as she wrote in clear, complete sentences using proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Although on her mock police report, it was woefully short of detail and documentation, predicting poorly for completing paperwork in a properly detailed fashion. Other than her below average score on the quantitative portion of the , she performed acceptably on our battery of standardized tests. Ms. Cosban is a 2007 graduate of Carthage College, where she received average grades and was part of a campus sorority during her time there. Overall, we believe Ms. Cosban has average to slightly above average mental ability based on the tests cited above, her educational background, and the way she expressed herself during her time at our offices and on paper. Thus, she should be able to learn the essential elements of the job in question, and we also believe this individual will show good judgment and common sense as she is serious-minded when it comes to doing her job.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Cosban to be an unacceptable  for the position in question at this point in time. Despite arriving late for her appointment at our office, Ms. Cosban made a relatively positive . As noted above, she seems sincere in wanting to change careers. While she scores high on our measures of excitement-seeking, she feels that making a difference in her work will be more rewarding than her former career in marketing and graphic design. In her two previous positions in marketing and graphic design, Ms. Cosban experienced downsizings which resulted in the elimination of her positions. We strongly suspect that the steadier nature of a municipal job appeals in many ways to the . With all of this said, we cannot endorse Ms. Cosban for the job in question. She has absolutely no preparation for this line of work. Moreover, she is reserved and rather reluctant to confront problems directly, which calls into question her ability to assert herself when necessary. Perhaps, with some exposure to a police agency through an auxiliary role like that of a CSO or another type of non-sworn role, Ms. Cosban will have an opportunity to experience law enforcement first hand, and decide whether she is comfortable in switching careers so dramatically. Nevertheless, in light of our stated concerns and reservations, we would not recommend that Ms. Cosban be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Hoffman Estates. \"',\n",

We administered two writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this  demonstrated acceptable writing ability. In particular, the candidate was fairly attentive to the important details. Furthermore, Ms. Cwayna wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, and generally made effective use of the proper grammar and syntax. As observed above, the  also performed acceptably on our battery of standardized tests, especially the . Given both the relative effectiveness of her writing skills along with her acceptable test results, it is not her book-smarts that we question. As noted in  of the report, Ms. Cwayna has managed to earn both a B.A. degree and an M.A. degree. On the other hand, we have serious doubts about her emotional intelligence, which is comprised of sound judgment and good common sense. Based on her past behavior, she is lacking in the critical cognitive areas related to successful police performance.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Cwayna to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. This is the third psychological examination that Ms. Cwayna has undergone in the past several years. According to the candidate, she has failed her two previous examinations, and she believes that her inability land a full-time police position is due to her problems at the police academy for the Cook County Sheriff e2 80 99s Department. The situation was created by Ms. Cwayna e2 80 99s own doing as she engaged in sending sexually suggestive messages to two of her classmates at the academy. The candidate claims that she was unfairly treated because her two classmates, who allegedly engaged in returning sexually-charged text messages, were not disciplined for their behavior. To look into the situation Ms. Cwayna has retained an attorney, but after three years no suitable remedies have been found to her satisfaction. This is not the only poor judgment Ms. Cwayna has exercised when it comes to dealing with members of the opposite sex. Recently, she sought to end a seven-year, allegedly abusive relationship by e2 80 9ccheating e2 80 9d on her boyfriend with a customer from her place of work as her way of e2 80 9cgiving him a hint e2 80 9d that the relationship was over. As our report states, Ms. Cwayna rates as a marginal candidate on nearly all the dimensions connected with success on the job.

In addition, Ms. DeAvilla paid attention to providing the proper spelling and grammar. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the  e2 80 99s career. The  demonstrated more than acceptable writing ability. In particular, Ms. DeAvilla e2 80 99s level of detail and information was excellent. Once again, she made use of the appropriate grammar and syntax. Ms. DeAvilla e2 80 99s written communication skills come as no surprise given her strong showing on the  portion of the . All things considered, the candidate has the ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. Based on our findings, however, we believe the candidate demonstrates excellent emotional intelligence as she is very attentive to the feelings and concerns of other people.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. DeAvilla to be an acceptable  for the position in question. There is a lot to like about this well-intentioned and sincere individual. According to the candidate, she felt e2 80 9clost e2 80 9d after graduating from college. We suspect that she might have harbored thoughts about turning her outstanding gymnastics skills into some kind of professional endeavor. During college at Illinois State University, Ms. DeAvilla participated in the Gamma Phi Circus. Her boyfriend at the time was able to land a professional position in a circus. Unfortunately, Ms. DeAvilla was unable to be hired into a similar position. The  e2 80 99s father suggested that she consider the fire service and EMS. He himself was a volunteer firefighter in Barrington a number of year ago. Ms. DeAvilla took his suggestion and enrolled in an EMT-B class at a local community college. From there she took a few fire science classes, and she has never looked back on her decision to seek a career in the fire service and EMS. With a strong , , and , she should be a pleasure to supervise. Given our favorable findings on this individual, we would recommend that Ms. DeAvilla be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Hanover Park. \"',\n",

Name: Jonah Deffenbaugh Position: Police Officer Age: 24 Department: Police Department Date: March 18, 2019     : Professionally attired in a dress shirt and slacks for his appointment at our office Well-groomed and polite presentation Engaged in conversation, but avoided eye contact at times and appeared timid Will be perceived as reasonably approachable by members of the public, but will not come off as assertive Level-headed and calm demeanor; will likely be seen as a credible police presence  y  : Open and honest; he is straightforward and has an air of trust Discussed his religious values and how they play an important n his life regarding the way he interacts with others Easy to get along with; however, he might take some time to fit in with a new department given some of his idiosyncrasies For example, he talked about his tendency to be e2 80 9csilly e2 80 9d and use e2 80 9cexaggerated body gestures e2 80 9d when he is excited or happy According to the candidate, a common misconception he believes others have of him is that he is goofy and happy all of the time; when really, he can be serious as well Even so, certain people might have a hard time working with this person e2 80 99s e2 80 9csilliness e2 80 9d Appears to be a bit immature, though he is kindhearted    : Has wanted to become a police officer since fifth grade when he met a police officer promoting D.A.R.E. at his school Interested in law enforcement in order to help others when they need it most Genuinely wants to contribute to his community Currently volunteers as a Will County auxiliary officer twice a week and is still in training for this role  relevant work and life experience  : Earned a bachelor e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice with a minor in music from Benedictine University in 2017 Completed an internship for a suicide prevention hotline while attending Benedictine University, but did not gain any direct experience with a police department at that time At present, this candidate volunteers as an auxiliary officer at Will County, where, as mentioned, he is still undergoing his initial training   : Raised by his parents to value honesty, respect, and strong work ethics Able to get the job done; he is rarely late or one to take sick days According to the candidate, his co-workers would describe him as fun, happy, and always willing to do more Claims to put e2 80 9cone hundred percent e2 80 9d effort into his work endeavors, but also is susceptible to becoming e2 80 9cbored with monotonous tasks, e2 80 9d which predicts for being selectively motivated    : No history of terminations or written disciplinary write-ups Verbally warned regarding a costly mistake resulting from his sending out the wrong product at his current place of employment Prefers working with a supervisor who he wants to respect and who is organized; he will give respect to anyone with whom he works Spoke positively about his past and present supervisors Lacks experience in a paramilitary setting, and moreover, his e2 80 9csilliness e2 80 9d might not be perceived well by supervisors in a paramilitary setting  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Described himself as e2 80 9ctimid e2 80 9d On that note, he admitted that he is most concerned about his lack of assertiveness as it relates to a career in law enforcement Struggled to sustain good eye-contact throughout his evaluation, which reinforces our observation that he is timid The nervousness he exuded will likely hinder him in successfully enforcing rules In his behalf, this candidate is very patient and will likely maintain a tactful approach with members of the public    : Described the toughest problem he faced was his father moving away from his family a decade ago; he had to learn a lot on his own Described a career in law enforcement as his first e2 80 9cbig boy job e2 80 9d Used longwinded stories to describe less-than-favorable situations such as the three traffic tickets he received and consuming marijuana a few times in college On that note, the verbiage he used when communicating sounded immature Currently lives with his mother, which has allowed him to avoid accruing any substantial financial obligations    : The timid nature of this candidate combined with his lack of self-awareness could cause him to struggle with stress When his current place of employment becomes stressful, he waits until after work to cope with his stress To relax outside of work and deal with stress, this individual enjoys bowling, listening to music and playing music, running, and spending time with his girlfriend of four years Has a strong but small support system from his significant other, a few close friends, and his family members  This candidate described himself as e2 80 9ctimid e2 80 9d on multiple occasions, and this description matched with his presentation during his evaluation at our office Candidate has a slow and disengaged way of communicating with others; this could be a result of his shyness His approach to communication and connecting with others could cause him challenges both within the department and with the public His e2 80 9csilliness e2 80 9d and signs of immaturity are characteristics that will be hard to change in his training        s)       Mr. Deffenbaugh scored very high on the standardized test we administered to him: the . His scores are consistent with his educational background. Additionally, Mr. Deffenbaugh spoke in a slow and longwinded manner, though his written and verbal communication skills are well-developed. To elaborate, he uses proper grammar and sentence structure to successfully get his points across, even when it takes him a long time to do so. In an exercise that asked Mr. Deffenbaugh to describe both a highlight and a setback he has experienced, he described the situations in detail and communicated his points effectively. Mr. Deffenbaugh e2 80 99s mental abilities are acceptable, yet we found the candidate to be lacking in another observable form of intelligence, his emotional intelligence. Mr. Deffenbaugh might struggle to understand the perspectives of others, since he already struggles to connect, and instead focus most on his own discomfort. The previously mentioned examples and traits are indicative of lower awareness and emotional intelligence. Overall, although this candidate possesses the logical reasoning skills, he does not have the emotional intelligence to carry out the job duties for the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Deffenbaugh to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. Mr. Deffenbaugh was born in Chicago and moved to Plainfield, Illinois, when he was young. Approximately a decade ago his father moved to South Dakota. The candidate reported that he did not know why his father moved, and he rarely sees him. Although the candidate said his family is e2 80 9cclose, e2 80 9d it did not necessarily seem that way based on his more detailed descriptions of his family. Mr. Deffenbaugh tended to describe things in one way, and subsequently connote something else. To give another example, he described himself as e2 80 9cfun, e2 80 9d e2 80 9coutgoing, e2 80 9d and e2 80 9csilly, e2 80 9d when during his interview, he rarely smiled and avoided eye contact throughout. Mr. Deffenbaugh seems to be a fairly genuine individual who wants to make a difference through his efforts in the community; however, his maturity and sense of awareness are not developed enough for him to become a police officer at this point in time. Although this candidate appeared to mean well, his demeanor and descriptions of things did not line up with the words he was saying. It is possible that with some more experience working in a police department as an auxiliary officer or a community service officer, this candidate could gain some of the skills that he currently lacks. Until then, we believe that he will struggle to make it through the required training and be able to connect with members of the public and his fellow officers. Therefore, in light of our cautious review, we would not recommend that Mr. Deffenbaugh be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Tinley Park. ERL/\"',\n",

On our written exercise requesting examples of a highlight and a setback in his life thus far, Mr. Defino did not offer a lot of detail, as he provided the bare minimum required of him on all of the written exercises used as part of the assesment process. As can be seen by his master-level performance on the  section of the , Mr. Defino should be able to effectively express himself well in writing. We suspect that the  has an aversion to paperwork and documentation, which would be keeping with our ealier  about his potential to be selectively motivated about certain tasks. Regardless, when it comes to seeking reimbursement for medical services, Mr. Defino e2 80 99s paperwork would benefit from a second set of eyes before submission. During his evaluation, we found Mr. Defino to be sensitive to other people, and this should serve him well in dealing with patients in an empathetic fashion. Overall, we evaluate this individual to possess the proper thinking skills in order to perform the essential functions of the job in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Defino to be an acceptable  for the position in question. It was during high school at Hinsdale Central that Mr. Defino first gave serious thought to entering the fire service when he took an emergency medical servcies class at the College of DuPage e2 80 99s local technology center which was open to secondary school students. Mr. Defino considered enlisting in the military as well. His father, however, talked him out of joining the armed servcies. Shortly after high school, Mr. Defino moved to Arizona, where he matriculated at Glendale Community College in Glendale, Arizona. After completing the requirements for his B.O.F., Mr. Defino earned his A.A.S. in fire science and emergency response. Upon completing his associate e2 80 99s degree, the  was asked to remain at Glendale Community College to teach a couple of classes for the school. During his time in Arizona, Mr. Defino also worked in a restaurant and bar for a few years, but he did not list the job on his Personal History Form. When the chain, the Riot Hospitality Group, asked the  to accept a new position at a venue they were opening in the River North area in Chicago, Mr. Defino decided to return to the Midwest. However, when Mr. Defino e2 80 99s father needed help in his printing business, the candidate took a job as a pressman with the company. Through all of these job changes, Mr. Defino has maintained his interest in becoming a firefighter/paramedic. As we noted in our findings, we believe that he can perform the job in an acceptable fashion. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Defino be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Hanover Park. \"',\n",

While written communication is not a major component of the position in question, Ms. DeRaedt will be required to submit paperwork and reports for reimbursement purposes pertaining to the EMS side of the job. As a result, we expect her to produce quality reports. Ms. DeRaedt is currently pursuing her associate e2 80 99s degree in fire science from McHenry Community College. Choosing to pursue her formal education many years after graduating high school, this candidate appears very motivated to learn and put her new skills to use.

We are confident that Ms. DeRaedt is fully capable of processing all she has learned about the fire service and emergency medical services and will apply it competently to her duties on shift.

While Ms. DeRaedt can be expected to take her duties and responsibilities seriously, there is a friendly and light-hearted side to her personality. There are times when her sense of humor was questioned, as it surfaced at the wrong time and place. A socially comfortable and fairly intelligent individual, Ms. DeRaedt is expected to listen to her superiors and incorporate feedback effectively, and we do not think this issue would cross over during emergencies. Members of the public and coworkers alike will appreciate her approachable and friendly manner, as this former restaurant server has worked with all kinds of individuals under stressful conditions. A former standout athlete in basketball and volleyball in high school, Ms. DeRaedt appreciates the value of teamwork and can function comfortably with others to accomplish a common goal. This individual has also demonstrated resilience in her personal life, when her first husband was unsupportive of her aspirations of entering the fire service. After weathering that divorce, Ms. DeRaedt moved on and is now in a stable marriage with a supportive husband, after turning her focus, once again, to pursuing her earlier career dreams.

We also administered two other writing samples, in which Mr. Di Vito demonstrated the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar and syntax, but there were also some misspellings and punctuation errors noted. Overall, this individual has the ability to produce informative and professional reports and documentation. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Di Vito possess slightly above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his grades during high school and college, and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. A mechanically-inclined individual, Mr. Di Vito focused primarily on shop and vocational classes at Lockport High School, graduating from there in 2005 with a reported 2.50 GPA. Encouraged by his parents to further his formal education in accounting, Mr. Di Vito struggled with the sedentary nature of that curriculum at Joliet Junior College, as he very much wanted a career in which he could work with his hands. Since deciding upon a fire service career, Mr. Di Vito was proud to report he has maintained a perfect 4.00 GPA in his fire science and EMS coursework to date, and remains a couple of classes short of obtaining his associate e2 80 99s degree in those areas. Moreover, Mr. Di Vito was named valedictorian of his fire academy class in which he distinguished himself. All things considered, this experienced firefighter and medic has already demonstrated his ability to master the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  Mr. Di Vito was born, raised, and continues to reside in Homer Glen where he attended local public schools. The oldest of three children, Mr. Di Vito credited his parents for the solid work ethic and sense of morals and values he possesses. This candidate envisioned himself working in the trades after high school, as he enjoys working with his hands and is very mechanically inclined. After several years at an automotive and tire shop working in a supervisory capacity, he began listening to the encouragement some of his close friends were giving to him about his goodness-of-fit for a fire service career. Once he began preparing his qualifications, Mr. Di Vito stated that he quickly resonated with nearly all aspects of the job in terms of community service, activity, excitement, and, of course, the manual and physical challenges. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Di Vito to be an acceptable  for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all the relevant dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. A personable and congenial individual, Mr. Di Vito came across as enthusiastic and positive about the opportunity to affiliate with a larger and well-respected fire district in which he anticipates increased chances for development, specialization, and possible promotion. This candidate has had only two jobs in his life, which speaks well about his loyalty, reliability, and stability which we believe will continue during the course of his career with the Frankfort FPD. While his needs for achievement are not particularly high, Mr. Di Vito is more concerned with the overall quality and competence of his work, and earning the respect and trust of his fellow firefighters and supervisors. In light of our review of his personality characteristics and qualifications, we would recommend that Mr. Di Vito be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Frankfort Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

Comes across as a bit e2 80 9cpoker-faced e2 80 9d and businesslike. Will need to work on his approachability. May appear listless or nonchalant initially, but we do not believe that is how this candidate functions on the job. At the same time, this  is smart, coachable, and assertive. Expected to grow and develop along with the job. May need to embellish his reports and documentation with a bit more descriptive elaboration.   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Diaz provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background which contained essential details and a degree of elaboration at times to clarify himself. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this  demonstrated average writing ability, as he was able to express himself in complete sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. This individual tends to be somewhat terse and concise in his writing style, and may need to be a bit more descriptive in his reports and documentation as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Diaz to possess average to perhaps slightly above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above, and by the way he was able to express his thoughts and ideas (orally and on paper) during his assessment. Mr. Diaz graduated from a small military academy in 2012 with a reported 3.70 grade point average. An avid bowler, this  was involved on the school e2 80 99s bowling and baseball teams. With a desire to follow in his father e2 80 99s footsteps in the business world, Mr. Diaz relocated to Florida where his father resides in order to attend the University of Central Florida to major in business administration. That did not work out very well for him as he was not interested in the subject matter, and we suspect he was too far from home in Chicago. As a result, he transferred to Wright Junior College where he went on to obtain his associate e2 80 99s degree with a minor in criminal justice in 2015. All things considered, this bilingual (Spanish) candidate should be able to master the essential information and skills required to become a police officer.  The oldest of three children, Mr. Diaz spent his developmental years in Chicago and graduated from Phoenix Military Academy in 2012. An outstanding student in high school, Mr. Diaz e2 80 99 interest in police work did not emerge until about a year ago when he began applying for selected police officer positions in the Chicago area. According to Mr. Diaz, the prospect of working in a profession in which his efforts have a direct and positive impact on society is especially appealing to him. While he does not come across with much animation or enthusiasm, this individual began assuming responsibility for himself and his actions at a young age due to circumstances in his family life. Along this line, he stated that he is most proud of steering clear of the bad influences in his life, and having kept his nose clean over the years. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Diaz to be an acceptable  for the position in question, as he received favorable ratings on all but one of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. Due to his relatively young age and limited exposure to police operations, it was challenging to assess this rather businesslike and sober young man e2 80 99s potential for effective police work long-term. Although he is not a particularly distinguished candidate, Mr. Diaz struck us as a dependable, determined, and assertive  who has the capacity to grow and develop along with the job after he has been properly trained. From our perspective, it might be advisable for this individual to take it upon himself to gain some related experience working retail security or perhaps as a community service officer before assuming a sworn police officer position. In light of our review, we would recommend that Mr. Diaz be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Skokie, Illinois. \"',\n",

We administered two writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On both of her exercises, this  demonstrated excellent writing ability. For example, the candidate was attentive to the important details. Moreover, she expressed herself well in writing by producing clear, definitive, and complete sentences. In addition, Ms. Diehl used proper grammar and syntax. We find this observation interesting in light of our  in  of this report about her self-acknowledged, questionable paperwork and report writing. Based on the exercises we presented to Ms. Diehl, we were unable to identify any such problems with her ability express herself on paper. The above-reported testing results are all satisfactory with exception of her low score on the quantitative section of the . In light of this lower score, it is not surprising it has been the  e2 80 99s inability to complete one remaining math class that keeps her from graduating from Sauk Valley Community College with her A.A.S degree. Nevertheless, we evaluate Ms. Diehl to possess the proper thinking skills as they pertain to performing the duties and responsibilities of the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Diehl to be an acceptable  for the position in question. Ms. Diehl is an experienced police professional, who has enjoyed her dozen years with the Sterling Police Department.

In order to be together, Ms. Diehl is electing to leave her present position in Sterling. Illinois. From all indications, she appears to be in good standing with her current department, and the few write-ups she received during her time with the agency occurred early in her career. We see this person bringing a positive attitude to her new job. She has been critical in the past of other police officers who gossip about one another and spread rumors which adversely impacts departmental morale. While gregarious and outgoing, there is a private side to Ms. Diehl. For example, she admits that she has not socialized afterhours with her fellow officers in Sterling. Illinois. Moreover, she likes to sit on her couch at home after shift and crochet as opposed to go out with other people. Nevertheless, she possesses excellent , which will be apparent to her fellow officers as well as the public at large. Therefore, in light of our review, we would recommend that Ms. Diehl be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of St. Charles. \"',\n",

Name: Brent Disterheft Position: Corrections Officer Age: 26 Department: Corrections Division Date: December 18, 2019     : Responsive to all forms of communications used for the assessment, including emails and texts Conscientious about the testing process, followed instructions well, and worked within the expressed timelines Punctual, arrived 45 minutes early for his scheduled appointment at our office In his behalf, the  was appropriately attired in a suit and tie Extremely polite, answering questions with e2 80 9cyes, sir e2 80 9d and e2 80 9cno sir, e2 80 9d reflecting his military background Came across as nervous and jumpy; has an anxious disposition  y  : As implied in our previous remarks, he is not very relaxed in the presence of other people We suspect that part of this problem might be attributable to his low self-esteem For example, when we asked the  about the biggest misconception his coworkers might have about him, he stated that other people think that he is an e2 80 9cidiot e2 80 9d When asked for clarification, the candidate stated that he often jokes around in the presence of his peers, which we interpret as his way of gaining much needed attention and recognition    : Given our prior  about his low self-esteem, we suspect that he is seeking status in the eyes of the public by working in corrections We believe that the candidate is sincere in wanting to make a positive difference in the lives of people who are in need of help and assistance Regardless, the variety and excitement are also very appealing to the  In his own words, he is looking for a job that can challenge him both physically and mentally Also seeeking a job that can give him an income to start a family and provide for it    : Served in the U.S. Navy for four years, between August of 2012 and October of 2016, as a nuclear mechanic on board an aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt Father is a retired firefighter, and this person initially prepared himself for a career in the fire service Received his A.S. degree in fire science from Miramar Community College in San Diego, California, in 2018 While serving on-board ship in the Navy, this individual was trained in fire safety, since shipboard fires are any vessel e2 80 99s biggest fear at sea Now, the candidate claims that he wants to become a police officer, so he is looking to use a position in corrections as a stepping stone to his ultimate career goal   : During his time in the U.S. Navy, the candidate committed an extremely serious mistake that resulted in a Captain e2 80 99s Mast, which is a disciplinary action that resulted in being reduced in rank and discharged prematurely Specifically, this individual deliberately lied about performing maintenance on a piece of equipment connected with his ship e2 80 99s nuclear power plant In fact, he lied on three separate occasions about performing an important maintenance operation We see this as an example of a lax  that will result in the  attempting to cut corners where he is able    : This person does have respect for those in positions of authority We see his laziness as the reason for him committing the error in the Navy instead of insubordination Requires order and structure; he gravitates towards occupations which can meet those needs He seems deferential as evidenced by his use of e2 80 9cyes sir e2 80 9d and e2 80 9cno sir e2 80 9d This person is looking for leadership that provides clear and concise guidance  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Without any practical exposure to law enforcement-related roles, it is hard to predict how this person would perform under pressure We observed him to be anxious by nature, which does not bode well for handling potentially dangerous situations in a calm and composed manner The above-reported carelessness on the part of this person does not bode well for him consistently handling responsibilities such as routinely inspecting inmate e2 80 99s living quarters With his lack of self-confidence, the candidate is likely to behave in a tentative fashion when asked to assert himself in emergency situations In short, he could create an officer safety hazard    : The  struggles to hold himself accountable for his actions In explaining the mistake that led to his discharge from the U.S. Navy, the candidate claims he was the only sailor singled out for disciplinary action when others committed similar acts of negligence During his time in the Navy, this individual also indulged in regular drug usage, to include smoking marijuana as many as 20 times and experimenting with cocaine while on leave Also during his time in the Navy, the candidate regularly consumed between eight and ten drinks in an evening    : Since leaving the military, the  has held a couple of short-term job assignments selling nutritional supplements Initially, this person placed an emphasis on entering the fire service and EMS, now he seems to have changed course for reasons that are not entirely clear, other than he originally wanted to please his father, a retired Skokie Firefighter While corrections will provide this person with the structure he seeks, we are worried about his lax behavior and tendency to cut corners, which will likely lead to the same outcome the candidate encountered in the Navy Presently single and lives with his father and stepmother, and he appears to have a limited network of friends and family for support To relax, he watches Netflix, plays videogames, and exercises five to six times a week Special Training, Orientation & Concerns We will defer on making any definitive orientation or training concerns as most of the problems and issues presented by this candidate are rooted in deep-seated personality characteristics which are not likely to change or be modified through education, mentoring, or guidance. Simply put, this  is not ready for the increased sense of responsibility, professionalism, and interpersonal finesse that will be required of him in the role of a corrections officer.        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Disterheft did a sufficient job of providing accurate and complete information. His Personal History Form was detailed, and on a written exercise asking about a highlight and setback in his life, Mr. Disterheft went into great detail, especially about the Captain e2 80 99s Mast he received for his negligent behavior in the U.S. Navy. As indicated by the  e2 80 99s above-reported scores on the , he is quite bright. As such, the errors the candidate commits on the job are not the result of his inability to learn or retain knowledge, but instead, they are reflective of a less than conscientious . What his well-written materials indicate to us is that Mr. Disterheft is capable of completing any paperwork and reports that will be required by the position in question. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Disterheft to possess the proper thinking skills and intelligence to handle the essential elements required to perform in the role of a corrections officer.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Disterheft to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. As a youngster, Mr. Disterheft e2 80 99s childhood was marred by several traumatic events that likely have had a lasting impact on him. First, his mother suffered from severe depression, and died tragically when the  was just a child. Meanwhile, Mr. Disterheft e2 80 99s father remarried a short time later, which was met with much resentment by the candidate and his brother. According to the candidate, no one in their family sought counseling. In joining the Navy, Mr. Disterheft was able to introduce a sense of structure and predictability into his life that was lacking from years prior. However, as we discussed in  of this report, the candidate committed a grievous mistake that resulted in severe disciplinary action taken against him, as he neglected on several occasions to properly inspect an important piece of nuclear equipment under his responsibility as a nuclear mechanic on board a large aircraft carrier. While Mr. Disterheft sees this incident as having changed his life forever, he also felt unfairly singled out because other sailors had committed similar acts of negligence. For our part, this incident is a serious one with implications for future behavior. For a public safety position, it is not worth taking a chance on candidates who cut corners or act in a careless manner on the job. Therefore, in light of our cautious review, we would not recommend that Mr. Disterheft be given an offer to work as a Corrections Officer for the Lake County Sheriff\\'s Office. \"',\n",

Name: Brent Disterheft Position: Firefighter Age: 26 Department: Fire Department Date: June 4, 2019     : Although he wore a neat haircut, candidate was unshaven for his appointment at our office In his behalf, the  was appropriately attired in a suit and tie Extremely polite, answering questions with e2 80 9cyes, sir e2 80 9d and e2 80 9cno sir, e2 80 9d reflecting his military background However, part of this person e2 80 99s polite mannerisms might be attributed to his anxious nature, which caused this candidate to come across as nervous and jumpy  y  : As implied in our previous remarks about this person, he is not terribly relaxed in the presence of other people We suspect that part of this problem might be attributable to his low self-esteem For example, when we asked the  about the biggest misconception his coworkers might have about him, he stated that other people think that he is an e2 80 9cidiot e2 80 9d When asked for clarification, the candidate stated that he often jokes around in the presence of his peers, which we interpret as his way of gaining much needed attention and recognition    : Sees serving in the fire service as providing him with a sense of honor Given our prior  about his low self-esteem, we suspect that he is seeking status in the eyes of the public through his membership in the fire service On the other hand, we believe that the candidate is sincere in wanting to make a positive difference in the lives of people who are in need of help and assistance Regardless, the variety and excitement are also very appealing to the     : Served in the U.S. Navy for four years, between August of 2012 and October of 2016, as a nuclear mechanic on board an aircraft carrier, the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt Received his A.S. degree in fire science from Miramar Community College in San Diego, California in 2018 Candidate has not completed his EMT-B or his B.O.F. certification However, while serving on-board ship in the Navy, this individual was trained in fire safety, since shipboard fires are any ocean-going vessel e2 80 99s biggest fear at sea   : During his time in the U.S. Navy, the candidate committed an extremely serious mistake that resulted in a Captain e2 80 99s Mast, which is a disciplinary action that resulted in his being reduced in rank and discharged prematurely Specifically, this individual deliberately lied about performing maintenance on a piece of equipment connected with his ship e2 80 99s nuclear power plant Lied on three separate occasions about performing an important maintenance operation We see this as an example of a lax  that will result in the  attempting to cut corners where he is able    : This person does have respect for those in positions of authority Instead, we see his laziness as the reason for him committing the error in the Navy Requires order and structure, and hence, he gravitates towards occupations which can meet those needs He seems deferential as evidenced by his use of e2 80 9cyes, sir e2 80 9d and e2 80 9cno sir e2 80 9d This person is looking for leadership that provides clear and concise guidance    : Without any practical exposure to emergencies and trauma, it is hard to predict how this person would perform under pressure We observed him to be anxious by nature, which does not bode well for handling emergency calls in a calm and composed manner The above-reported carelessness on the part of this person does not augur well for him consistently handling responsibilities such as routinely inspecting the ambulance to make sure it is properly stocked with the appropriate medical supplies With his lack of self-confidence, the candidate is likely to behave in a tentative fashion when asked to assert himself in emergency situations    : The  struggles to hold himself accountable for his actions For example, in explaining the mistake that led to his discharge from the U.S. Navy, the candidate claims he was the only sailor singled out for disciplinary action when others committed similar acts of negligence During his time in the Navy, this individual also indulged in regular drug usage, to include smoking marijuana as many as 20 times and experimenting with cocaine while on leave Also during his time in the Navy, the candidate regularly consumed between eight and ten drinks in an evening    : Since leaving the military, the  has held a couple of short-term job assignments, selling nutritional supplements While the fire service will provide this person with the structure he seeks, we are worried about his lax behavior and tendency to cut corners, which will likely lead to the same outcome the candidate encountered in the Navy Presently single and lives with his father and stepmother, and he appears to have a limited network of friends and family for support To relax, he watches Netflix, plays videogames, and exercises five to six times a week Special Training, Orientation & Concerns As our report indicates, we are not very optimistic about this person e2 80 99s prognosis for success in the fire service, and hence, we are reluctant to suggest any training or coaching remedies that would likely prove effective with this individual        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Disterheft did a sufficient job of providing accurate and complete information. His Personal History Form was detailed, and on a written exercise asking about a highlight and setback in his life, Mr. Disterheft went into great detail, especially about the Captain e2 80 99s Mast he received for his negligent behavior in U.S. Navy. As indicated by the  e2 80 99s above-reported scores on the , he is quite bright. As such, the errors the candidate commits on the job are not the result of his inability to learn or retain knowledge, but instead, they are reflective of a less than conscientious . What his well-written materials indicate to us is that Mr. Disterheft is capable of completing paperwork and reports that will be required by the position in question. As such, the department should be able to invoice accurately for any emergency medical services that Mr. Disterheft performs under his watch. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Disterheft to possess the proper thinking skills and intelligence to handle the essential elements required to perform in the role of a firefighter/paramedic.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Disterheft to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. As a youngster, Mr. Disterheft e2 80 99s childhood was marred by several traumatic events that likely have had a lasting impact on him. First, his mother suffered from severe depression, and died tragically when the  was just a child. Meanwhile, Mr. Disterheft e2 80 99s father remarried a short time later, which was met with much resentment by the candidate and his brother. According to the candidate, no one in their family sought counseling. In joining the Navy, Mr. Disterheft was able to introduce a sense of structure and predictability into his life that was lacking from years prior. However, as we discussed in  of this report, the candidate committed a grievous mistake that resulted in severe disciplinary action being taken against him, as he neglected on several occasions to properly inspect an important piece of nuclear equipment under his responsibility as a nuclear mechanic on-board a large aircraft carrier. While Mr. Disterheft sees this incident as having changed his life forever, he also felt unfairly singled out because other sailors had committed similar acts of negligence. For our part, this incident is a serious one with implications for future behavior. For a public safety position, it is not worth taking a chance on candidates who cut corners or act in a careless manner on the job. Therefore, in light of our cautious review, we would not recommend that Mr. Disterheft be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Skokie. \"',\n",

 admits to having this characteristic Coupled with his admitted drug use as recently as last spring, the  drinks alcohol to excess Consumes up to 12 drinks in an evening at least six times a year As stated earlier, this individual is a thrill-seeker who has a history of acting impulsively In light of these findings, his potential for job burnout will be greater  In light of our findings, we do not see this person as ready to assume the responsibilities of becoming a full-time police officer Perhaps, in time and with disciplined abstinence from drugs and alcohol, he might at some point re-apply to become a police officer   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE  ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Douglas possesses legible handwriting and he tends to print his words neatly. We administered two writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On these exercises, this  demonstrated marginally acceptable writing ability. For example, the candidate was not attentive to the key details in his mock police report. His performance on this exercise shows a lack of conscientiousness. In his behalf, however, he wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, and made effective use of the proper grammar and syntax. As can be seen from his above-reported test scores, Mr. Douglas is bright. Although he has the mental ability to learn the information necessary in any new job, we greatly question this candidate e2 80 99s common sense and judgment as evidenced by his past and relatively recent behavior regarding his consumption of illegal substances. At this point in time, we do not feel that Mr. Douglas will properly apply the information he has learned to the actual performance of his duties.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Douglas to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. We found Mr. Douglas to be a likeable individual, but at this time our many concerns regarding his judgement, discipline, and conscientiousness far outweigh those positive qualities in relation to the position in question. With a father who has spent his entire career in law enforcement, the  initially resisted becoming a police officer. In fact, Mr. Douglas admits fighting the idea of becoming a police officer. Now, out of college with a three-year old daughter, he has become concerned about protecting those who cannot help themselves, like children and the elderly. He recently has made some effort to get related experience by working in a juvenile detention center, and his  would lend well to the community service aspect to the job. On the other hand, Mr. Douglas has engaged in reckless behavior that has jeopardized his chances for a career in public safety. The  now regrets not listening to his father who told him that his excessive drug and alcohol use would likely disqualify him from consideration as a police officer candidate. Most disconcerting to us is that it has been only about a year since Mr. Douglas stopped smoking marijuana to excess, and even his current consumption of alcohol seems a bit excessive. Besides this admitted behavior and poor judgment, at this point in his life, the candidate has shown an inconsistent  and a lack of conscientiousness. Therefore, in light of our many stated concerns and reservations, we would not recommend that Mr. Douglas be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Country Club Hills. \"',\n",

voluminous information provided on required questionnaires and exercises Carried herself in a mature, confident, and straightforward way Expressed herself as respectful and mild-mannered Despite her somewhat diminutive physical size, this individual has the capacity to project an approachable and capable presence as a police officer  y  : Comes across as rather serious and businesslike on  (which she is) This  has a background in competitive team sports and has worked collaboratively with various groups and organizations over the years Generally agreeable and good-natured, but she will hold her own in an argument or disagreement Average needs for inclusion and acceptance from others; selective in her choice of close friends Should be able to forge amicable working relationships with her peers and superiors    : Rates high on our measures of altruism  has extended herself in order to assist and help others on and off the jobs she has held Equally drawn to the enforcement and community service aspects involved in police work Anticipates working in a fast-paced position which will involve a good deal of variety and mental and physical challenges Solid customer service background; will be polite and courteous in her interactions with the public  relevant work and life experience  : Bachelor e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice and psychology from Loras College in 2016; no internship While on campus, candidate was involved as an emergency management and security specialist on a part-time basis for three years Employed as a security officer and supervisor at Six Flags for three and one-half years Enlisted in the USAF-Reserves in August of 2017;

above average critical thinking skills and officer safety awareness    : Rather open and candid in revealing some of the regrets and disappointments she has had in her life thus far We do not believe she is normally this candid in discussing her feeling and personal life Introspective individual who is able to evaluate and hold herself accountable for problems and difficulties when they occur No illicit drug use; no brushes with law enforcement Began assuming responsibility for herself and her actions at an early age Although she still resides with her mother, we found this  to be a mature, independent, and self-sufficient adult    : Stable, focused, and level-headed, yet rather competitive (especially with herself) Expects a lot of herself; can be her own worst critic May be prone toward episodic worry and frustration, but she comes across as a e2 80 9ctough cookie e2 80 9d Tends to keep these feelings to herself; may require some encouragement to talk things out with more senior officers and supervisors if she appears troubled on the job Small but supportive base of family and friends Tends to relax and blow off steam through physical activity and being outdoors with trusted friends  It may be easy to underestimate this individual e2 80 99s courage and tenacity on  during her field training and probationary period. May also appear to be a bit brash and blunt, which we believe is rooted in her attempts to overcome some underlying insecurities. At the same time, she is a kind and compassionate person with a strong drive to serve and protect the public. A bit of support, reassurance, and encouragement will go a long way with this candidate, as we anticipate that she may show some leadership potential in the years ahead once she has mastered essential job functions.   Below Average Average Above Average   ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE  ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE  ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Ms. Duarte provided a prolific and thorough account of her personal and professional background that contained essential details and a great deal of elaboration. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this  demonstrated above average writing ability, as she consistently expressed herself in clear and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. A bright and very literate individual, Ms. Duarte e2 80 99s perfectionism in expressing herself on paper lacked for conciseness, as she tried to include every imaginable detail to make sure she was understood. With her report writing this  may require some guidance and training in isolating essential from non-essential details. Otherwise we expect her documentation to be professional and informative. Overall, we evaluate Ms. Duarte to possess above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by her grades during high school and college, and by her scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above. Despite some adversity with her family situation, this achievement-oriented individual participated in numerous extracurricular activities throughout her formal education ranging from church youth groups to assuming leadership roles in athletics and campus organizations while also working part-time. She obtained her bachelor e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice and psychology from Loras College in 2016 while also being the captain of the school e2 80 99s lacrosse team, serving as president of a couple of campus volunteer organizations, and working extended hours for the college e2 80 99s public safety department. In summation, Ms. Duarte is a very active, highly determined, and involved young woman who will not have difficulty mastering the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  According to Ms. Duarte, her father was in and out of her life until her junior year in high school. Raised by her mother and grandmother, Ms. Duarte maintained that her father is e2 80 9cnot really a bad person e2 80 9d despite his gang involvement and drug abuse, which led to several interventions by local law enforcement in her hometown of Carpentersville throughout her developmental years. After one particularly egregious incident during a domestic dispute between her parents a female officer took the time to console and reassure her during this tumult and angst, who then returned the next day with a teddy bear and the offer to be there whenever the candidate needed her. As an only child without anyone to talk to, this incident remains as a guiding force for this motivated candidate, as she would very much like to be in a position in which she can provide the same type of kindness and reassurance she received from that Carpentersville Police Officer. Since that time, Ms. Duarte has applied herself diligently toward making something of herself that she would be proud of despite the adversity and anxiety she felt during her childhood and adolescence. We believe she has accomplished that in many ways, and she now wants to be in a role in which she can make a positive impact on the lives of others, which includes both the enforcement and customer service aspects of the job. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Duarte to be an acceptable  for the position in question, as she received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. A thorough and deliberate individual, Ms. Duarte thought long and hard about the career path she wanted to take, as well as taking on some related law enforcement jobs to ensure that she would be a good fit for a law enforcement career, including her enlistment in the Air Force Reserves where she assumed a leadership role during her Flight as second in command. Overall, we were impressed with this candidate e2 80 99s perseverance, conscientiousness, and drive to overcome what we believe were some deep-seated feelings of insecurity and inferiority in her younger years. As she stated during her interview in reflecting on her achievements, e2 80 9cI was determined not to fail. e2 80 9d From a psychological perspective, this  e2 80 99s self-discipline, work ethic, and altruism will facilitate her ability to effectively perform the essential job functions of a police officer. In light of our positive review, we would recommend that Ms. Duarte be extended an offer of employment to serve as a Wheaton Police Officer. \"',\n",

We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On the handwritten exercise, in particular, this  demonstrated very poor writing ability, as he was totally inattentive to details. Moreover, because he produced such an inferior written product, we cannot accurately assess if the  is able to write in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, and also make effective use of the proper grammar and syntax. Because of Mr. Duplessis e2 80 99 strong showing on the , it is hard to believe that he is unable to produce written communication in a quality manner. Mr. Duplessis e2 80 99 showing on our written exercises might predict for selective motivation as this person will pay less attention to the administrative aspects of the job in question. With that said, however, police reports, and any paperwork that is a matter of public record will need monitoring at least initially so his cases cannot be thrown out of court on a technicality.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Duplessis to be an acceptable  for the position in question. As our reports states in , this person is still very much a work-in-progress at age 22. We believe that Mr. Duplessis e2 80 99 motivation for wanting to become a police officer is acceptable. While he enjoys variety and excitement, the thrill-seeking side of his personality is unlikely to get him into trouble with his superiors. This individual is also likeable, but his need to project a friendlier manner is also apparent. Nevertheless, the citizens of the community will find the  approachable enough as well courteous and respectful. We do have some concerns, however. Perhaps, out biggest reservation about Mr. Duplessis relates to inadequate written communication as measured by the assessment process. The candidate e2 80 99s paperwork and report writing will require careful monitoring to make sure that when he produces a written product it is not tossed out of court on a technicality due to the candidate e2 80 99s carelessness. On balance, if this motivated individual can be given good coaching and guidance from his superiors, Mr. Duplessis has the potential to develop into an effective member of the department. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Duplessis be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Hazel Crest. \"',\n",

Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Erri to be an acceptable  for the position in question, as she received favorable ratings on all the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. During her high school years, Ms. Erri was a good athlete and an excellent student. Upon graduating from high school, this candid and straightforward individual admitted that she had no idea about her vocational plans upon entering Benedictine College. Since she enjoyed being of assistance to others, she initially thought about becoming a special education teacher. When a friend talked about some of the criminal justice classes she was taking and how interesting they were, Ms. Erri enrolled in some introductory courses and quickly changed career directions. According to Ms. Erri, police work fit the bill for all the things she wanted in a job: community service, activity, variety, and mental and physical challenges. Since that time, Ms. Erri has taken several steps to prepare herself for a policing career by completing her degree in criminal justice, serving a law enforcement internship, and working retail security. Most recently, she has been serving in the capacity of a patrol officer with the Lindenhurst Police Department, which she enthusiastically stated that she very much enjoys.

Can be rather hard on himself after mistakes.        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Fanelli provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background which included essential details, but not much elaboration. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this  demonstrated average writing ability as Mr. Fanelli was able to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. As hinted above, this individual tends to be rather terse and concise in his writing style. May need to be a bit more descriptive and detailed in his report writing duties. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Fanelli to possess average to slightly above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his grades during high school and college, and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. A 2015 graduate of Ridgewood High School, Mr. Fanelli was unsure of his vocational future upon entering the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2015. Stating that he always had positive relationships with the police during his youth, he went on to major in criminology, law, and justice, and he expects to receive his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in that area in two weeks.

Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Fanelli to be an acceptable  for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. At the age of 22, this  has applied himself in an energetic and determined manner to prepare himself for a law enforcement career by furthering his formal education in criminal justice, completing a law enforcement internship, and by gaining some direct experience as an auxiliary officer with Rosemont Public Safety. Despite his relatively young age, this  carries himself in a confident and congenial manner, and he looks forward to the mental and physical challenges that await him in this line of work. Somewhat businesslike and serious in his manner, this candidate may appear a bit intense on . Although he will not have difficulty initiating interaction with citizens of all ages and with coworkers, this  also has a private side and may sometimes prefer more solitary or isolative activities off the job. Overall, we expect him to be a team player who demonstrates respect and courtesy to his supervisors and his fellow officers. Finally, Mr. Fanelli came across as equally motivated to perform both the customer service and enforcement aspects of the job. We anticipate that he will represent the department with honor and pride in the years ahead. In light of our review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Fanelli be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of River Grove, Illinois. \"',\n",

some may question his authority on  Bearded and neatly attired for his apointment at our office, wearing slacks, a dress shirt and a tie  y  : Polite and respectful manner Tends to be more shy and reserved than he might appear upon first meeting him Open and sincere On the other hand, he is a jumpy and excitable individual Scores in the highest ranges on our measures of anxiety The  e2 80 99s anxiousness is reflected in his inability to articulate his words with clarity An energetic and expressive communicator, he tends to gesture with his hands Seeks to avoid conflict and rarely engages in arguments or disputes with other people    : Active in volunteer activities at his church, St. Terrence in Alsip Scored high on our measures of altruism; shows an active concern for the welfare of others Stated that as a resident of Alsip, he is eager to serve his community as he is currently doing as a crossing guard On the other hand, he is worried about losing friends because in his own words, e2 80 9cyou e2 80 99re the cop e2 80 9d While this person seems sincere in wanting to serve and protect the community, there are other compelling reasons that the candidate is seeking to become a police officer For example, he rates very high on our measures of excitement-seeking behavior Like many stress prone people, this person is looking for a high degree of variety and excitement in his career  relevant work and life experience  : Has taken classes in criminal justice while pursuing his A.A.S. degree at Moraine Valley Community College Successfully completed the Alsip Citizen e2 80 99s Police Academy in 2018 Currently serves as a safety crossing guard with the Alsip Police Department As a safety crossing guard, he has had to deal with a relatively small number of incidents related to enforcing the law; occasionally has to contact the police about strange behaving individuals wandering near his crossing guard post   : While he has only been affiliated with the Alsip Police Department since August of this year, he has been employed in a custodial position at his church, St. Terrence, for almost four years, since nuary of 2016 Dedicated and loyal employee Rarely calls off sick to work Has been tardy in the past four years on only five occasions Hardworking, currently holds two jobs: with the Alsip PD and the other at St. Terrence    : Raised with a healthy respect for those in positions of authority Has never been arrested or even received a traffic ticket Reports no disciplinary actions against him at any past or present place of work Seeks a great deal of guidance and direction from his superiors Naturally anxious, he will be unsure of himself and look to his leaders to validate his actions On the other hand, he was terminated from a job a number of years ago for not following his boss e2 80 99s directions carefully enough  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Fails to project much of a credible police presence due not only to his shorter stature, but also because of his excitable temperament Moreover, when excited, this person is not particularly good with his words As implied, the  is unsure of himself and lacking in self-confidence, which will have negative implications for his ability to project a command presence Nevertheless, we have concerns about his ability to hold the line when his authority is challenged Overall, we see it as a major leap from his role as a safety crossing guard to the job of a police officer on the street    : Raised by both parents with a strong moral code of ethics As implied above, he is very active with his church and at one time even taught CCD classes for St. Terrence Has exercised good judgment by staying away from illegal drugs Admits to drinking four to five beers at least twice a month The candidate current resides with his parents as well as a younger brother Single and reports at age 27 never having been in any kind of a serious relationship    : With high levels of anxiety, the pressure and stress of the job is likely to be overwhelming to him Prone toward prolonged periods of worry or depression Scored high on our measures of self-conscience; will be sensitive to ridicule and may internalize negative feedback from a difficult training regime As noted above, the  possesses a stress-prone personality, which means he seeks thrills and excitement in order to be stimulated by his endeavors on and off the job Unfortunately, individuals possessing this kind of personality profile are probably the least suited to operate under pressure and stress To help keep his stress levels in check, the  is an avid exerciser; reports working out seven days a week  Lacking self-confidence, this candidate might be better served working in the capacity of a Community Service Officer (CSO) or some other type of police auxiliary position. This experience would help bolster his confidence.        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Farenga submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate, but not especially complete with the sufficient amount of detail and information. Mr. Farenga did, however, make the proper use of spelling and grammar on his Personal History Form. We also administered two other writing samples, which included a mock police report as well as a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the  e2 80 99s career in law enforcement. On both of these exercises, this  demonstrated acceptable writing ability, once again, using appropriate grammar and syntax. In addition, he provided the pertinent amount of details. The above-reported scores on the  are rather reassuring and predict positively for the  e2 80 99s ability to learn the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. Regardless, we believe this candidate demonstrates an acceptable level of emotional intelligence as he is a compassionate and understanding individual.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Farenga to be a less than acceptable  for the position in question. Working at present for the Alsip Police Department, the members of the agency are more familiar with Mr. Farenga than most people. As a result, they know and understand this person e2 80 99s work habits and attitudes, which we strongly sense would be rated in a positive fashion. Clearly, there is a lot to like about this candidate. Mr. Farenga is a hardworking, dedicated and loyal individual. We observed him to be polite and respectful during the assessment process. In short, we see him as sincere. At the same time, there are aspects of this person e2 80 99s temperament that strike us as ill-suited for working as a police officer on the street. The  is highly anxious. We observed him to possess an excitable temperament. Through no fault of his own, Mr. Farenga is possessed with a small physical stature in terms of his height and weight. Moreover, the  lacks the verbal skills required to take control of a potentially dangerous situation. In sum, it is a large and likely unrealistic leap from being a safety crossing guard for the Alsip Police Department to becoming an officer in the agency. As a result, we think that employing Mr. Farenga as either a CSO or some other type of auxiliary officer might serve as a workable solution. Nonetheless, in light of our overall cautious review, we would not recommend that Mr. Farenga be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Alsip. \"',\n",

The key for this individual will be learning and performing essential job functions at the street level during his field training and probationary period. Candidate is very inexperienced and appears to have some unrealistic beliefs about what will be required of him as a police officer. Enthusiastic and socially adept individual, but may come across as a bit contrived and ingratiating initially. Needs to slow down in order to become more circumspect and deliberate in his decision making in terms of situational awareness and officer safety concerns.   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Fedler provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background which was detailed and organized. In addition, he offered some elaboration when it was necessary. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this  demonstrated average to above average writing ability, as he consistently expressed himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, punctuation, and syntax. We believe this individual is fully capable of producing professional and informative reports and documentation as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Fedler to possess above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his academic and occupational accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above. Mr. Fedler graduated from Lowell (IN) H.S. in 2007 with a reported 2.80 GPA. During his high school years, he captained the school e2 80 99s tennis and golf teams. Although he wanted to major in criminal justice in college, Mr. Fedler gave into his mother e2 80 99s wishes that he pursue another type of career other than police work. As a result, he minored in criminology at Indiana State while earning his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in electronic media in 2011. He also received an associate e2 80 99s degree in cinematography from a rather prestigious institution (Tribeca Flashpoint College) in 2012. All things considered, Mr. Fedler has the ability to master the essential information and skills required to become a police officer.  Mr. Fedler is the younger of two children who spent his developmental years in Lowell, Indiana, where he attended local public schools. As noted in  of this report, Mr. Fedler e2 80 99s vocational goal upon graduating from high school was to become a police officer because of the respect and admiration he had for the local police in Lowell and the school resource officers he encountered. Deferring to his mother e2 80 99s wishes that he pursue a less dangerous line of work, Mr. Fedler accommodated her, but never lost his desire for a law enforcement career. After nearly six years in the video / electronic media industry, Mr. Fedler maintained that if he was ever going to achieve his dream, now is the time after his recent marriage and his previous video editing job fell apart. Drawn to the pride, status, and opportunities to provide a more meaningful service to others, Mr. Felder has been testing for selected police officer positions for the past four months. Disheartened by not landing a prized police officer position during that time, Mr. Fedler did not anticipate the rigorous testing and hiring process which most entry-level candidates have accepted as a matter of course in public safety work. We cite this as an example of some of his unrealistic expectations of what police work actually entails, and his goals going forward. While he is bright, assertive, and socially adept, he is very green and inexperienced in any type of enforcement role. As such, some education, mentoring, and patience on the part of his field training officers and supervisors is recommended. From a psychological perspective, we evaluate Mr. Fedler to be an acceptable  for the position in question, as he received favorable ratings on all but one of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. This  has the potential to develop into a competent and capable addition to the department. In light of our review, we would recommend that Mr. Fedler be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Wheaton, Illinois. \"',\n",

the candidate claims that he did not do anything and when he refused to run, he was ensnared by the police These incidents occurred in his early twenties; we see them more as indiscretions of youth and not reflective of his current maturity While the  generally holds himself accountable for his actions, he might show signs of defensiveness in the face of constructive criticism Married for the past seven years to a woman he met in high school; the couple has three children Has been financially responsible; expected to honor his commitments and obligations    : For more than ten years this person has been performing acceptably in the fire service and EMS We see few, if any, obstacles to his continued successful performance as a firefighter/paramedic More recently, the candidate cut back on his second job with Shindler Elevator because of the long hours, especially involving installations at downtown Chicago high rise buildings Has no harmful habits; his reported consumption of alcohol is rather minimal as well as infrequent As with many excitement-seekers, the  relaxes with ATV e2 80 99s and snowmobiles Has a supportive family Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Caution about becoming defensive in the face of constructive feedback aimed at improving his behavior on the job        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Frank submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate, but exceptionally light on sufficient detail. In his behalf, the form reflected proper spelling and grammar. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the  e2 80 99s career. The  demonstrated acceptable writing ability, provided sufficient detail, and also paid close attention to using the appropriate grammar and syntax. We sense that routine forms are probably not terribly exciting for him, but he will make an effort to complete them accurately. With respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate has demonstrated good EQ as evidenced by his description of suffering with the families of patients and accident victims. While his scores on the above-reported  are mixed, all things considered, the candidate has the ability to master the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Frank to be an acceptable  for the position in question. The candidate claims that his initial interest in the fire service occurred at a young age, when both he and his brother were brought to the same firehouse that employed his uncle, who was a member of the Chicago Fire Department. The  acknowledges struggling at first with EMT training, having failed the state certification test twice. In his behalf, Mr. Frank persisted in his efforts and eventually passed the state certification examination. Mr. Frank would then go on to earn his B.O.F. as well as his paramedic e2 80 99s license. For the past ten or more years he has been in good standing with the Evergreen Park Fire Department. This person has performed well, and he highlights saving a four-year-old child choking on a gumball at a local Walmart store. This person truly enjoys every aspect of the fire service from the thrill of responding to the tones, to the camaraderie that he experiences in the firehouse itself. There is little that he dislikes other than having to respond to minor calls, and of course, witnessing injury to children. As our report indicates, there is a lot to admire about this , and we believe that he will be a valuable addition to the department. Therefore, in light of our overall, favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Frank be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Palos Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

received his training at an academy in Jefferson City, Missouri   : This person can be expected to operate in a proactive manner For example, when he has been assigned to routine traffic patrol, he has been very productive in writing citations for motorists who broke the law Also proactive in responding to domestic disputes, which in his present agency averages at least two to three per week Eager to improve his skills as implied previously in this report, the candidate has been part of the narcotics unit as well as a SWAT team Presently functioning in the capacity of an FTO with the Fulton (Missouri) PD    : The  was raised to respect authority To date, he has never been terminated from any previous place of work Furthermore, he reports no disciplinary actions taken against him Prefers to answer to a leader who demonstrates high personal and professional integrity Thrives on honest and straightforward feedback so he can find ways to improve his performance on the job  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Currently works in a diverse community, in terms of race and socioeconomic levels Has been very comfortable with this kind of diversity and understands the importance and value of treating all people with dignity and respect Admitting that it took him a while to master the finer points of the job when it came to handing potentially dangerous encounters, he is now comfortable in his role With an imposing physical presence, it is doubtful that many citizens will look to challenge this officer e2 80 99s authority Due to his physical size and calming manner, this individual has had very few physical encounters during the course of his career in law enforcement    : Moving to the Chicago area to follow his significant other who was raised in Joliet Candidate was raised with a healthy set of moral values such as respect for hard work and honesty; carries those values with him personally and professionally Never arrested as a youth, yet admitted to using marijuana to excess during high school  attributes this behavior to his attempts to navigate the anger he felt after the sudden and untimely loss of his father during high school Overall, we anticipate that the  will hold himself accountable for his actions    : To date, nothing has deterred this person e2 80 99s enthusiasm for his career in law enforcement With that said, he understands the pressures involved in a line of work dealing with life and death matters Has his finances under control at this time; we do not expect him to feel the stress of money problems while on the job Although this individual used marijuana excessively during high school, we are confident that period in his life is behind him He shows no signs of having an addictive personality According to the , his consumption of alcohol has been sensible  Clear-cut goals and expectations about his work Open and straightforward feedback on his job performance   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE  ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Green provided an accurate and well-written account of his personal and professional history. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed), and Mr. Green offered detailed documents while writing in complete sentences using proper grammar and syntax. The deliberation and focus the candidate put forth in this portion of our assessment process predicts favorably for handling police paperwork and reports in an effective manner. Mr. Green is an experienced police officer, and we expect him to handle administrative requirements of the position in a capable and effective fashion. The candidate attempted two semesters of college after high school in different areas of study, but neither fared particularly well due to a variety of reasons. After a couple years gaining maturity and working through finances, the candidate redoubled his efforts towards a law enforcement career. Now that he has direction and purpose, Mr. Green shows excellent scores on our tests of cognitive ability shown above. We also observed Mr. Green e2 80 99s high degree of emotional intelligence, which is a positive indicator that he will exercise good judgment and common sense in carrying out duties and responsibilities of the role.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Green to be an acceptable  for the position in question. His prospective employer, the Hazel Crest Police Department, is getting an experienced officer. An outstanding athlete in high school and college, Mr. Green played football and wrestled. After receiving money to play at a small college in Missouri, Mr. Green struggled with his studies, and we also suspect that he might have been homesick. Regardless, he dropped out of college and found himself adrift. This included letting his physical conditioning go to waste. After finally regaining his peak conditioning Mr. Green was faced with a choice: the military or law enforcement. Choosing the latter, he began his career in corrections. At present, he is a full-time sworn police officer in a diverse community in Fulton, Missouri. There is a lot that he likes about both the job and the department which employs him. However, he is in a four-year relationship with a young woman who is in the field of nursing, and she would like to move closer to her home in the greater Chicago area. As a result, Mr. Green is making application for the job in question. He believes that the department would be a good fit for his talents and abilities, and we would agree with his self-assessment. As noted above, he has many fine qualities that predict for success as a police officer, and in light of our review, we would recommend that Mr. Green be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Hazel Crest. \"',\n",

We also administered two other writing samples to Mr. Gutierrez. In all exercises, this bilingual (Spanish)  demonstrated above average writing ability as he consistently expressed himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. This individual is fully capable of producing professional and informative reports and documentation as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Gutierrez to possess at least average mental ability despite his surprisingly low scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. This assertion is supported by his academic and occupational accomplishments to date, and by the manner in which he was able to express his thoughts and ideas (orally and on paper) during his assessment. Mr. Gutierrez attended St. Patrick High School in Chicago for two years before his family relocated to suburban Burbank. As a result, he obtained his diploma from Reavis High School where he was involved in sports and began working part-time his senior year. Immediately after his graduation, Mr. Gutierrez shipped out for a four-year hitch with the Marine Corps. On his behalf, he resumed his formal education after his honorable discharge and obtained his bachelor e2 80 99s degree from a college which was stripped of its accreditation after his graduation which has dulled the luster of a degree he worked hard to obtain. Nevertheless, this  has already demonstrated his ability to perform the essential information and skills required of a police officer, and he has worked in that capacity in some unique venues.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Gutierrez to be an acceptable  for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. The oldest of four children, his parents separated in 2007, and he credits his strong work ethic to his mother who reportedly raised him with strong morals and values. In fact, he lives with her presently serving as a caretaker. As noted in  of this report, this individual has worked only in military and paramilitary organizations in several different law enforcement venues. More specifically, he spent two years with the City of Chicago e2 80 99s Aviation Police, and he has been employed as an officer for the Veterans Administration for the past year. Mr. Gutierrez has also worked for two municipalities including the Dolton Police Department where he came to know a couple of Riverdale Police Officers on mutual aid calls. Along this line, he is well aware of the type of policing done in the south suburbs, and he looks forward to the challenges that await serving a community in a helping capacity once again. Overall, we like the balance and maturity presented by this candidate in terms of his military background, conscientious work habits, and mission orientation. We anticipate that he will prove himself to be a fine addition to the department and to the community of Riverdale rather quickly. In light of our positive review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Gutierrez be extended an offer of employment to serve as a Police Officer for the Village of Riverdale, Illinois. \"',\n",

Name: Ryan Hartmann Position: Police Officer Age: 25 Department: Police Department Date: October 16, 2018     : Clean-cut personal appearance marked by his short hair cut Professionally attired in a dress shirt and tie for his appointment at our office He appears emotionally distant thought he speaks in a respectful manner The  will be seen as rather standoffish and self-focused  y  : Unlikely to open up emotionally to others, even though he has extroverted tendencies Prefers to work with others Even-keeled; not given to drama Displays a stiffness about him and reported that a common misconception others have of him is that he is e2 80 9ccold and standoffish e2 80 9d During the interview this person was a bit prickly, but was able to engage in conversation Lacks foresight and discusses his mistakes in a blas c3 a9 fashion Not someone who would necessarily add or detract from positive team morale Appears to take himself rather seriously although he reported that he laughs a lot and likes to have a good time    : Reported that he decided to pursue a degree in public service when he was younger Comes from a family of law enforcement professionals; both his father and uncle worked as Chicago police officers, and his grandfather was a Cook County sheriff Stated that he wants to become a police officer because he wants to assume a leadership position and be a e2 80 9cprotector of the community e2 80 9d Mentioned wanting to be the one taking on situations others are unwilling to be a part of Hopes to be a police officer so that he can undergo personal growth Mentioned that he values officer and civilian safety  relevant work and life experience  : Earned his B.A. degree in health and human physiology from the University of Iowa in 2015 Did not complete any coursework related to public service even though he planned on pursuing a career in public service Since graduating from college he has worked for Chicago Fury as a coach and strength trainer for athletes Has not completed any internship, any ride-alongs, or any education related to public safety   : Raised to value hard work although his actions have demonstrated a rather disjointed career path moving from personal training to starting his own business to pursuing a career in law enforcement Difficult to gauge if this individual has the stamina it takes to sustain a career in law enforcement Reported that he least enjoys working with co-workers who make excuses and do not take responsibility for their actions Reported that he is seen by coworkers as someone who has a good work ethic, takes initiative, and is always on time Received feedback from his past and present supervisors that he should e2 80 9cspeak up more often, e2 80 9d and be more assertive when it comes to commanding a room of people at work, especially when they are getting too rowdy    : Prefers to work with a supervisor who provides clear guidance, is direct, tells the truth, and is e2 80 9cbrutally e2 80 9d honest in providing feedback Reported no history of terminations or disciplinary actions against him at work Seems to get along well with his past and present supervisors Given his family history in the Chicago Police Department, this person is familiar with paramilitary settings by association Seems to respond to authority in a casual yet respectful way  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Enforces rules with groups of athletes at his current job including ensuring noise control when he is working with large groups As previously stated, he has received feedback that he could improve his assertiveness when working with large groups Reported that he tends to be quiet and has been told that he should speak up more Does not appear to be particularly assertive or commanding, this will be a growth opportunity for him With the proper guidance he should be able to enforce rules in a tactful and effective manner; yet being assertive is not necessarily in his nature    : Arrested in college for possessing marijuana and a fake I.D.; arrested one year later for public intoxication Attempted to start his own business where he planned to buy and consolidate physical therapy clinics; however, the business failed, and he accrued $30,000 in debt Reported this venture failed because he was unprepared Reports to consume alcohol about once a month and will consume a maximum of five drinks on each occasion that he drinks Currently lives with his parents Grandparents paid for his undergraduate education and bought his car; has no unpaid financial obligations other than $14,000 of remaining credit card debt from his failed business venture    : Possibly does not truly understand the requirements of becoming a police officer due to his lack of adequate , despite his father being a retired police officer If extended the opportunity, he may or may not maintain his position in the police force based on his career history of changing his vocational focus rather frequently To elaborate, this candidate has put a lot of time and effort into pursuing a career in fitness and has only more recently taken steps to joining the police force Works out six times per week, goes on walks, spends time with friends, and listens to music and podcasts in order to relax This person appears to have a strong support network of family and friends Currently has no harmful habits which would inhibit his ability to perform the job in question  Provide some assertiveness training to this candidate; it seems that being assertive is outside of his comfort zone Given this person e2 80 99s young age, he will need time to grow and mature into the position in question by gaining enforcement experience, for example   Below Average Average Above Average   ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE  ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE  ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, he completed them in a detailed and complete manner. He filled out his Personal History Form using complete sentences and proper grammar. Mr. Hartmann paid close attention to the forms we had him complete and demonstrated strong written communication skills. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On both of his exercises, this  demonstrated good writing ability, as he was attentive to details and wrote in clear, succinct, and complete sentences. Moreover, the candidate e2 80 99s above average scores on the standardized tests shown above point to his developed intellectual abilities. With all of that being said, there are concerns about his emotional intelligence. To elaborate, Mr. Hartmann struggles to connect easily with others and does not overtly demonstrate the compassion or empathy necessary in becoming a police officer. Moreover, he has received feedback about being too lenient with enforcing rules at his current place of work. Overall, this person e2 80 99s emotional intelligence left us questioning his overall judgment.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Hartmann to be a less than acceptable  for the position in question. He has not demonstrated that his career judgment is well-formed. He has pursued a career in fitness and has experienced failure along the way due to what seems to be a lack of necessary preparation and general maturity. Mr. Hartmann is respectful enough, but carries himself in a blas c3 a9 and detached fashion that might not be received well on the police force. Mr. Hartmann seems to lack foresight in his career decisions and appears more passionate about personal training than joining the police force. It seems that the main reason for him pursuing a career in law enforcement is his family history and beating the odds of getting hired despite his record of previous arrests rather than personal reasons. Regardless, this individual has plenty of developmental opportunities that need to be addressed in order for him to have a successful career as a police officer. Thus, a main concern is lack of career stamina, or grit, for this individual. For example, he reported that in high school he was an average student who did not apply himself. It seems that not fully applying himself has carried over into adulthood. Mr. Hartmann was self-focused and might struggle during officer training and more importantly he might decide this choice of a career is not appropriate if the going gets tough for him. To Mr. Hartmann e2 80 99s credit, he does seem to value community safety and the career of a police officer. However, he does not appear to be emotionally mature enough or prepared enough to take on the position in question. Therefore, in light of our overall questionable review, we would not recommend that Mr. Hartmann be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Hoffman Estates. \"',\n",

Name: Robert Higgins Position: Firefighter Age: 32 Department: Fire Department Date: November 14, 2019     : Completed his preparatory materials after the time they were requested for review Arrived about 10 minutes late, stating that he was tardy due to traffic, but he did notify our office of his situation Clean-cut and well-groomed; dressed professionally in a suit and tie Offers a firm handshake Not especially engaging  y  : Rather reserved and somewhat detached individual Wants to project a military bearing, which this person interprets as acting in a restrained and self-disciplined fashion Although he never was a member of the armed services, feeling as though he projects a military air enhances the  e2 80 99s sense of self-esteem Regardless, he is not a terribly outgoing individual; is unlikely to bond closely with his fellow firefighters    : Finds the fire service as a career which will give this individual a strong sense of self-fulfillment Believes that by helping people, he is engaging in meaningful work Enjoys the hands-on and physical component to the work Feels as though learning EMS will provide him with valuable life skills Rates about average on our measures of altruism and scores very high with respect to his needs for excitement    : EMT-B from Malcolm X College in 2016 Paramedic license in 2018 from St. Francis Hospital in Evanston, Illinois B.O.F. from NIPSTA, which was awarded in 2019 Spent less than a year between July of 2017 and March of 2018 with Medex Ambulance Services Currently serving the Village of Lincolnwood, Illinois, as a firefighter/paramedic through a contract with Paramedic Services of Illinois (PSI); joined the company in December of 2018   : Prior to joining the fire service and EMS, the  had a whole other career selling software services At two of those jobs, he was terminated for failing to meet his es goals We believe that his transition from es to the fire service and EMS has been a healthy one Not an especially assertive or driven individual; having to meet es quotas was not a good fit for his aptitudes and talents Rates about average on our measures of conscientiousness, which predicts for meeting the demands placed upon him    : In es and in a consulting capacity, marketing business solutions to small companies, the candidate worked strictly for himself Used to having plenty of freedom and autonomy While he has experienced terminations, he has not been disciplined for improper behavior at any past or present place of work Seeks a supervisor who provides him with the rationale for orders and activities given by his superiors Possesses a low tolerance for ambiguity and will require clarity from his superior officers in the fire service Followed the rules throughout his life fairly consistently; expected to do the same with guidelines and policies    : Acknowledges that he could show more confidence at the scene of medical emergencies His fellow fire medics have commented that the candidate appears hesitant to act Admits that he has not been exposed to a lot of trauma thus far in his work, due largely to inconsistent call volume at his present place of work To date, the worst that he has been exposed to are the bad living conditions he observes when attending to patients in their homes We see this matter-of-fact individual striving to deliver a steady standard of care With the proper training and some life experience and maturity under his belt we expect this  e2 80 99s skills in this area to gradually improve over time    : After an arrest for battery ten years ago at the University of Illinois, the candidate greatly reduced his consumption of alcohol; his bar fight taught him a valuable life lesson Came across as honest in discussing some of the regrets and disappointments he has had in his life thus far; able to learn from his mistakes Other than this major incident, this person has lived a clean life; reports never having used any kind of illegal drugs Married to a woman who works as an executive recruiter in the northern suburbs Has been fiscally responsible; the couple carries no debt    : Understands the downsides to working in the fire service and EMS Aware of the interruptions to his sleep patterns along with the potential health risks involved in the field After making the change from es to the fire service, he seems to have found a home for himself Does not consume alcohol to any extent, and he has no other potentially harmful habits that would impair his ability to perform the job in question To relax, he likes to read For activity, he enjoys exercise and a variety of outdoor activities, like fishing, snowboarding, camping, and hiking Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Coaching on providing a more approachable presence to both patients and coworkers alike Practice and repetition of his EMS skills in order to improve his level of confidence with medical emergencies        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Higgins submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate and contained sufficient information and detail while using the proper spelling and grammar. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the  e2 80 99s career. The  demonstrated acceptable writing ability, once again, paying attention to the appropriate grammar and syntax. In addition, he also paid attention to the pertinent details. The above-reported scores on the  are also reassuring, and they predict positively for the candidate e2 80 99s ability to develop into a capable fire medic. All things considered, the candidate has the ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, in spite of his detached way of interacting with people, there is an element of emotional intelligence in the way that the candidate discusses his concerns for patients, and in particular, many of the squalid living conditions that he has witnessed when transporting patients for medical care.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Higgins to be an acceptable  for the position in question. Given the way that Mr. Higgins interacts with people, it would be easy to underrate him as a viable candidate for the job. This person fails to show much feeling and enthusiasm. In short, he is rather stiff and matter of fact, generally coming across as reserved. These qualities will be readily apparent to his peers and officers in the firehouse. As a result, it is unlikely that he will form warm or close personal bonds with his fellow firefighter/paramedics in the department. At the same time, he is not the kind of person who will keep strictly to himself. At the scene of a fire or medical emergency, this person will probably be seen as cautious, relying on the other senior and experienced fire medics to take the lead. However, we predict that with time and experience in the service, he will show more initiative. On the job, his only difficulties occurred when he was working in es and failed to meet his assigned quota. The fire service and EMS are very different occupations, and this person e2 80 99s previous problems are unlikely to plague him in his new role. Overall, this person possesses acceptable work habits. While he is not the strongest all-around  we have evaluated for similar roles, he is acceptable, nonetheless. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Higgins be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Schaumburg. \"',\n",

is unlikely to bond closely with his fellow firefighters    : Finds the fire service as a career which will give this individual a strong sense of self-fulfillment Believes that by helping people, he is engaging in meaningful work Enjoys the hands-on and physical component to the work Feels as though learning EMS will provide him with valuable life skills Rates about average on our measures of altruism and scores very high with respect to his needs for excitement    : EMT-B from Malcolm X College in 2016 Paramedic license in 2018 from St. Francis Hospital in Evanston, Illinois B.O.F. from NIPSTA, which was awarded in 2019 Spent less than a year between July of 2017 and March of 2018 with Medex Ambulance Services Currently serving the Village of Lincolnwood, Illinois, as a firefighter/paramedic through a contract with Paramedic Services of Illinois (PSI); joined the company in December of 2018   : Prior to joining the fire service and EMS, the  had a whole other career selling software services At two of those jobs, he was terminated for failing to meet his es goals We believe that his transition from es to the fire service and EMS has been a healthy one Not an especially assertive or driven individual; having to meet es quotas was not a good fit for his aptitudes and talents Rates about average on our measures of conscientiousness, which predicts for meeting the demands placed upon him    : In es and in a consulting capacity, marketing business solutions to small companies, the candidate worked strictly for himself Used to having plenty of freedom and autonomy While he has experienced terminations, he has not been disciplined for improper behavior at any past or present place of work Seeks a supervisor who provides him with the rationale for orders and activities given by his superiors Possesses a low tolerance for ambiguity and will require clarity from his superior officers in the fire service Followed the rules throughout his life fairly consistently; expected to do the same with guidelines and policies    : Acknowledges that he could show more confidence at the scene of medical emergencies His fellow fire medics have commented that the candidate appears hesitant to act Admits that he has not been exposed to a lot of trauma thus far in his work, due largely to inconsistent call volume at his present place of work To date, the worst that he has been exposed to are the bad living conditions he observes when attending to patients in their homes We see this matter-of-fact individual striving to deliver a steady standard of care With the proper training and some life experience and maturity under his belt we expect this  e2 80 99s skills in this area to gradually improve over time    : After an arrest for battery ten years ago at the University of Illinois, the candidate greatly reduced his consumption of alcohol; his bar fight taught him a valuable life lesson Came across as honest in discussing some of the regrets and disappointments he has had in his life thus far; able to learn from his mistakes Other than this major incident, this person has lived a clean life; reports never having used any kind of illegal drugs Married to a woman who works as an executive recruiter in the northern suburbs Has been fiscally responsible; the couple carries no debt    : Understands the downsides to working in the fire service and EMS Aware of the interruptions to his sleep patterns along with the potential health risks involved in the field After making the change from es to the fire service, he seems to have found a home for himself Does not consume alcohol to any extent, and he has no other potentially harmful habits that would impair his ability to perform the job in question To relax, he likes to read For activity, he enjoys exercise and a variety of outdoor activities, like fishing, snowboarding, camping, and hiking Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Coaching on providing a more approachable presence to both patients and coworkers alike Practice and repetition of his EMS skills in order to improve his level of confidence with medical emergencies        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Higgins submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate and contained sufficient information and detail while using the proper spelling and grammar. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the  e2 80 99s career. The  demonstrated acceptable writing ability, once again, paying attention to the appropriate grammar and syntax. In addition, he also paid attention to the pertinent details. The above-reported scores on the  are also reassuring, and they predict positively for the candidate e2 80 99s ability to develop into a capable fire medic. All things considered, the candidate has the ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, in spite of his detached way of interacting with people, there is an element of emotional intelligence in the way that the candidate discusses his concerns for patients, and in particular, many of the squalid living conditions that he has witnessed when transporting patients for medical care.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Higgins to possess many fine attributes for the position in question. Given the way that Mr. Higgins interacts with people, it would be easy to underrate him as a viable candidate for the job. This person fails to show much feeling and enthusiasm. In short, he is rather stiff and matter of fact, generally coming across as reserved. These qualities will be readily apparent to his peers and officers in the firehouse. As a result, it is unlikely that he will form warm or close personal bonds with his fellow firefighter/paramedics in the department. At the same time, he is not the kind of person who will keep strictly to himself. At the scene of a fire or medical emergency, this person will probably be seen as cautious, relying on the other senior and experienced fire medics to take the lead. However, we predict that with time and experience in the service, he will show more initiative. On the job, his only difficulties occurred when he was working in es and failed to meet his assigned quota. The fire service and EMS are very different occupations, and this person e2 80 99s previous problems are unlikely to plague him in his new role. Overall, this person possesses acceptable work habits. While he is not the strongest all-around  we have evaluated for similar roles, he received favorable ratings on most of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a firefighter, nonetheless. We will defer to the Board of Police and Fire Commissioners for the Village of Skokie to arrive at a final decision on Mr. Higgins e2 80 99s suitability for hire with the Skokie Fire Department. \"',\n",

Name: Tyler Hook Position: Police Officer Age: 25 Department: Police Department Date: November 16, 2018     : Well groomed and professionally attired for his appointment at our office Likeable and engaging manner High energy individual who did not stop shifting his body and fidgeting throughout the entire interview Hence, the  appeared very nervous and as a result, he might not be viewed as a credible police presence by the public due to his incredibly nervous demeanor Anxiousness resurfaced at the end of the interview when he asked the psychologist several questions about Tinley Park e2 80 99s application process, likely a result of his nervousness  y  : Will likely get along well on a team; likeable and empathetic Has compassion for others and is able to relate to people while maintaining a nervous demeanor Nevertheless, this person demonstrates limited self-awareness For example, when he was asked if he was feeling nervous he would continuously say that he was not Not one to talk about his emotions; he prefers keeping his relationships e2 80 9cprofessional e2 80 9d Often interrupted himself and sometimes did not answer the question that was asked of him because he went off on a tangent    : Long-standing interest in law enforcement Knows some friends who are in law enforcement, and the candidate claims that he is familiar with the field through association Prefers being out in the field rather than working a desk job Likes the variety the job has to offer  relevant work and life experience  : Currently working in his first professional job, which is at a commercial real estate agency, Insite RE Inc., as a site acquisition specialist Started a career in real estate in March 2017 Bachelor e2 80 99s degree in agrobusiness from Illinois State University received in 2015 No law enforcement internship or ride-along experience   : Worked as a landscaper and server during college Interested in physical fitness and puts effort into maintaining fitness Appears to be selectively motivated; seems to put the most effort into his hobbies, which include running and martial arts States that he has been interested in law enforcement, yet he has not taken any of the necessary steps to gain relevant experience In his behalf, he always tries to be a little early for work and values punctuality Has received feedback from supervisors that he needs to improve his attention to detail and overall focus    : Rigid thinker; he will likely respond well to structure and clear rules Lack of focus might hinder his ability to follow instructions or rules correctly Has severed attachment with his early authority figures; he has very limited contact with his mother because of the way she handled divorcing his father Was raised by his parents to be respectful, hardworking, polite and punctual Prefers working with a supervisor who is understanding and supportive No history of terminations or disciplinary actions against him  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Overall, this person lacks any experience enforcing rules He was so shifty and fidgety that it caused uncertainly about if he will be able to make rational decisions and judgments especially if they pertain to safety Despite this person e2 80 99s athletic physical presence, his nervousness and anxiety will make it challenging for him to enforce rules or take charge when necessary Easily distracted, and this trait might effect his ability to stay assertive and organized, especially in an emergency situation On the other hand, he will demonstrate tact in his compassionate approach to others    : Appears to possess adequate maturity for a 25-year-old person Lives with his father in Tinley Park who pays for the candidate e2 80 99s rent and car Has $30,000 in student loans Reports never experimenting with illegal drugs or alcohol; no history of arrests or traffic tickets According to the candidate, the toughest problem he has ever faced in his life is opening up to people emotionally Has been in a committed relationship since March of 2018    : As a police officer, he will be faced with resistance and he might become even more disorganized and flustered in the face of negative interactions with others Given this person e2 80 99s exceptionally nervous demeanor in an interview setting, it is unclear if he will be able to cope with job-related stress Has only had one consistent job, which becomes frustrating for him when he has to deal with e2 80 9crude customers e2 80 9d In his behalf, this person employs healthy coping skills outside of work include aerobic activity and spending time with his significant other  Carelessness and lack of focus could cause issues with his paperwork and other aspects of the job that require attention to detail Nervousness and anxiety are traits that are very difficult to change, and they will significantly impact his ability to successful perform the job duties for the position in question   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s online materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Hook provided an accurate account of his personal and professional background and experience. His answers were quite brief, and they did not seem to contain the level of attention to detail one might expect from a committed entry-level candidate. As previously stated, his lack of focus and tendency to go off on tangents could hinder him from completing paperwork in a thorough and diligent manner. Mr. Hook will need to improve his focus and organization in order to complete proper police documentation and reports adequately. Mr. Hook possesses acceptable intellectual abilities based on his scores on our tests of mental ability cited above and his grades throughout high school and college. With that said, his focus and self-awareness are not well developed. Moreover, the  e2 80 99s anxiety, distractibility, excitability and lack of preparation are what make us question if he is suitable candidate for the position in question. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Hook to possess the proper thinking skills, yet he does not possess sufficient emotional maturity, judgment, and common sense in order to perform the position in question in an acceptable fashion.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Hook to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. Mr. Hook lives with his father in Tinley Park and is the middle child of three siblings. His parents divorced in 2012, and since then he has not spoken with his mother due to the way she handled the divorce. This individual avoids talking about his feelings and exudes anxiety and disorganization. Mr. Hook was so fidgety he dropped things during the interview, and he was unable to maintain focus on the questions asked of him. A few times he had to ask the psychologist to repeat a question and then would go on tangents that were irrelevant to the topic at hand. Although his heart seems to be in the right place and he is a likeable individual, this person is so full of nervous energy that he could not even focus during the interview. Therefore, it would be hard to believe that he would be able to sustain focus and demonstrate confidence as a police officer given his behavior at our office. Mr. Hook has significant developing and maturing to do in order to be eligible in the future for this position. It would also benefit him to gain experience working in an auxiliary capacity or any relevant position, so he can have a better idea of what the job will entail. Overall, although this candidate e2 80 99s high energy and likability are engaging, Mr. Hook does not have what it takes to be a police officer at this time. Therefore, in light of our many stated concerns and reservations, we would not recommend that Mr. Hook be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Tinley Park. ERL/\"',\n",

Name: Preston ckson Position: Firefighter Age: 26 Department: Fire Department Date: October 4, 2019     : Conscientious about the testing process, followed instructions well, and worked within expressed timelines Arrived one hour early for his appointment Sloppily attired for a job-related interview, wearing a sports jersey To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he was polite and friendly On the other hand, he proved very difficult to interview due to his detached attitude along with his lengthy and circular answers to our questions  y  : Although the  gave a number of roundabout answers to questions, it is quite clear that the candidate is an articulate individual who chooses his words thoughtfully We suspect that his hard to interpret answers were his way of trying to manage his impression in a favorable light This person demonstrated poor eye contact, often looking out the window of the psychologist e2 80 99s office In short, he seemed distracted and detached as well as disengaged According to the candidate, he has e2 80 9cno interest e2 80 9d in the opinions of him others may have Finally, there is a critical side to the candidate e2 80 99s disposition that he frequently directs toward his coworkers    : We believe that this person is sincere in his desire to help people and serve the public On the other hand, the variety and excitement of the job is appealing to the  He rates high on our measures of thrill-seeking behavior The pace and variety of the fire service keeps the candidate interested and invested in his job Finally, while the candidate claims that he enjoys the camaraderie of the fire service, he also made a number of critical  about his fellow employees    : According to the candidate, he does not have his EMT-B He does, however, have a CPR license, which he earned in 2018 Received his B.O.F. in 2012 through the MABAS Division 24 Fire Academy in Homewood, Illinois For the past eight years, he has been serving in the capacity of a firefighter with the Village of East Hazel Crest, Illinois   : In his behalf, this individual has been gainfully employed for the past eight years with the East Hazel Crest Fire Department He has also been steadily employed for the last three years as a machine operator for a manufacturing company, Innophos On the other hand, this person was terminated from a job with U-Haul six or seven years ago in an alleged dispute with a new manager Unfortunately, the  e2 80 99s explanation of the circumstances surrounding his termination were hard to follow, so we are not entirely sure why he was let go from U-Haul    : The candidate was quite critical of his past and present bosses In particular, he sees management as set in their ways and resistant to change With a low tolerance for ambiguity, this individual requires frank feedback from his superiors In addition, the  makes it quite clear that once he has mastered his job, he wants to be left alone with a minimal amount of supervision and direction Finally, he wants to feel free to express his views to management about his job and the conditions surrounding his work    : With only his certification in CPR, the candidate provides minimal emergency care Nonetheless, the candidate claims that he has helped perform CPR on full arrests as well as administering oxygen to patients and taking their vital signs This person is experienced in fighting structural fires According to the , his department has done an extensive amount of firefighting when called to emergencies in neighboring Harvey, Illinois    : In discussing his suspended license, the  struggled to recall the details When asked why it was so hard to cite specific dates and details, the candidate responded that once a situation is in the past, he seeks to e2 80 9cforget about it e2 80 9d Overall, we believe it will be hard for the  to hold himself accountable for his actions There is a tendency on this person e2 80 99s part to make excuses for himself Is divorced; he and his ex-wife share a child together, and she has one of her own from a prior relationship    : Given the  e2 80 99s longevity at his present places of work, we believe that he will remain at his place of employment as long as he avoids any clashes with authority A private and introverted individual, this person keeps to himself As a result, he relies on few friends and family for support When he has been faced with traumatic incidents on the job, he has turned along with his fellow fire medics to debriefing sessions handled by outside professionals Not surprisingly for a solitary individal, this person relies heavily on running as his primary means for reducing tension and stress On the other hand, when he has had an admittedly rough week, the candidate wil consume between four drinks of hard liquor or as manay as six to seven beers Special Training, Orientation & Concerns When asked about what areas he could improve, this person responded by saying he was e2 80 9c not sure e2 80 9d which predicts poorly for accepting feedback and making significant changes in one e2 80 99s behavior        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. ckson did an extremely poor job of providing clear and complete information on his Personal History Form. Not only were his responses insufficiently short, but Mr. ckson also omitted from his Personal History Form certain job experiences, including his time at U-Haul, a position from which he was terminated as mentioned previously in  of this report. On his highlights and setbacks exercise, Mr. ckson listed rather succinctly two examples from his career to date. There is no question that this candidate possesses a strong command of the language. First, Mr. ckson scored at the mastery level of the  section of the  cited above. Second, the  is an articulate individual who picks his choice of words very carefully. Our sense is that mundane tasks like completing paperwork and filling out reports rate low on the  e2 80 99s list of priorities; hence, they will receive less attention from Mr. ckson. Overall, there is no question that we evaluate this person as able to possess the proper thinking skills required to master the essential elements of the firefighter e2 80 99s position.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. ckson to be a less than acceptable  for the position in question. This report has raised a number of issues and concerns about the candidate. As we mentioned at several junctures in our report, we experienced a great deal of difficulty interviewing this individual. Mr. ckson seemed both disengaged and detached when asked certain questions. In those instances when he was required to explain certain incriminating circumstances, such as a termination from a job or a suspension of his driving privileges, the candidate offered convoluted and wordy explanations that were hard to follow in terms of logic. We suspect that this kind of behavior was Mr. ckson e2 80 99s attempt to save face. We also observed a critical streak in this candidate that can quickly identify deficiencies that he observes in the way that his employer seeks to manage him and the others in its employment. This kind of complaining -- especially from an articulate individual -- will produce a negative impact on departmental morale. Finally, we believe that it will be hard for this  to accept responsibility for his shortcomings and mistakes. His inability to hold himself appropriately accountable along with his inability to hear constructive feedback from other people will likely prove problematic if he is offered the job in question. Therefore, in light of our clearly stated concerns and reservations, we would not recommend that Mr. ckson be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Matteson. \"',\n",

In addition, the  also used proper spelling and grammar on his Personal History Form. We also administered two other writing samples, which included a mock police report as well as a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the  e2 80 99s career in law enforcement. On both of these exercises, this  demonstrated acceptable writing ability while using the appropriate grammar and syntax. We were particularly impressed with this person e2 80 99s ability to provide pertinent details. An experienced police officer, Mr. cobs should be able to handle the paperwork and report writing piece of the position in question. We are also impressed with the score registered by Mr. cobs on the . All things considered, the candidate has the ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe that he demonstrates acceptable emotional intelligence as he is able to show empathy for others.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. cobs to be an acceptable  for the position in question. By his own admission, he is a driven and intense individual. The major turning point in this person e2 80 99s life came during his time in the military. As a member of the armed forces, he became an Airborne Ranger in the U.S. Army and achieved rank rather rapidly. Life in the military was made for Mr. cobs. The product of a broken home and a troubled childhood, Mr. cobs had a strained relationship at best with his biological father. With a childhood that seemed to be spinning out of control, Mr. cobs likely found life in the Army to be just the stabilizing influence that he needed. Clearly, this pivotal experience has impacted the candidate for the better. On the other hand, his life in the Army has become the basis of comparison for everything else that has followed, which means as a police officer, the candidate is continuously comparing his peers and superior officers to his fellow soldiers and commanding officers. The comparisons, however, have not always been favorable. If Mr. cobs is to perform effectively in his new role, he will have to make positive adjustments in his attitude and perspective. We believe that the candidate is capable of making the adjustment over time. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. cobs be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Crystal Lake. \"',\n",

Will probably need to grow into a e2 80 9ccommand presence. e2 80 9d Somewhat youthful in his appearance. Nevertheless he is confident in his abilities and skills.   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE  ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. pcon provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that contained essential details and a degree of elaboration when it was helpful or necessary. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this  demonstrated above average writing ability, as Mr. pcon was able to amply demonstrate his ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. On the basis of our assessment, Mr. pcon has the capacity to produce professional and informative reports and documentation as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. pcon to possess above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his educational accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above. During his high school years, Mr. pcon was a three-sport athlete, who graduated with a reported 3.10 GPA. With the intention of becoming a police officer, Mr. pcon set off for Illinois State University where he went on to earn his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice in 2016, graduating with average grades. This fairly bright and highly energetic individual has the ability to master the essential information and skills required to become a municipal police officer.  The elder of two children, Mr. pcon e2 80 99s parents divorced when he was in the fifth grade, which caused him to change schools while moving to Tinley Park with his mother. This was reportedly a difficult time for the candidate, who acknowledged that it was his hope that his parents would remain together. Over time, Mr. pcon adapted to this situation as his father remarried and he continues to have a close relationship with his father and step-mother. For the most part, this rather social and outgoing individual has kept his nose clean throughout his life, and he seemed earnest about his desire to serve and protect the citizens in his home community of Tinley Park. Although he was awarded a bachelor e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice from Illinois State, it would have been helpful if he had followed through with the internship option, as he really has not had any direct exposure to police operations, not even a ride-along. Nevertheless, we expect this conscientious and fairly bright  to catch on quickly during his training and education as a police officer. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. pcon to be an acceptable  for the position in question, as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. A bit of an extrovert, Mr. pcon is expected to forge collaborative working relationships with his fellow officers, and his customer service background will facilitate his ability work comfortably with citizens and businesses in the community. Although he may be rough around the edges with his minimal experience and job knowledge, we believe a bit of patience on the part of his field training officers and supervisors will help him develop into a capable and effective addition to the department. In light of our review, we would recommend that Mr. pcon be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Tinley Park, Illinois. \"',\n",

he said the reason for the termination was because he was a e2 80 9cbig mouth e2 80 9d and did not get along with his supervisor Recalled an experience in the Army soon after the above-mentioned termination that reminded him the value of discipline and respect; he has not had any issues with authority since then and has earned an E-6 rank Expected to follow rules and orders; may be interested in sharing ideas to improve processes as well Humbled by his experience serving the country;

he will strive to provide the best service to members of the community in which he resides. This bright candidate will be open to feedback and learning how to improve; he will want to meet and exceed the expectations of his superiors. He seems to us to be a good-hearted individual who can come off as direct and straightforward when there is a job that needs to get done.        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Johnson provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that included ample details and plenty of elaboration. He was a bit more direct and succinct when speaking, although he was articulate in both his verbal and written communication. This individual is fully capable of expressing himself in complete and coherent sentences that contain proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Mr. Johnson is expected to produce professional reports and documentation for the position in question. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Johnson to possess above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his grades throughout high school and college, and by his occupational accomplishments to date. Mr. Johnson graduated from Riverdale high school in Port Byron, Illinois, in 2005 with a reported 3.6/4.0 GPA average. Mr. Johnson wanted to further his formal education, so he earned his paramedic license in 2010 from Blackhawk College. Mr. Johnson has applied himself diligently in the military to better his skills and qualifications as a medic. These skills will serve him well in a career position in the fire service. All things considered, this individual can master the essential information and skills required of a firefighter and paramedic.  Mr. Johnson is the only child born from the marriage of his parents, who are still married, yet he grew up with two older half-sisters. Both his mother and his father each brought into their union a daughter from a previous relationship. The upbringing Mr. Johnson experienced took place in a religious household in Port Byron, Illinois, where he lived with his parents who taught him to value respect and discipline. Mr. Johnson enjoys close relationships with those in his immediate and extended family yet spoke of having to weather the unfortunate loss of one of his sisters some years ago. Mr. Johnson talked about his commitment to service that started since he graduated from high school. He spoke positively about his career in the military and feels confident that transitioning to the fire service is the right career move for him. Mr. Johnson has worked hard to better his skills and qualifications for a career position in the fire service. His experience with the medical component of the fire service is extensive, and although he will need further instruction and training on the fire suppression side, we do not have any doubts of his ability to get up to speed and learn all that will be required of him. Mr. Johnson claims that his ultimate career goal is to be a Firefighter for the Village of Bolingbrook given its reputation among other firefighters he knows, and because of the convenient location and proximity to his newly purchased home. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Johnson to be an acceptable  for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. While his tendency to be business-like and seem stern at times might take some getting used to, Mr. Johnson will be appreciated for his energy, intelligence, commitment, hard work, and loyalty to his coworkers. Mr. Johnson has managed to get along well with others throughout year-long deployments across the world. Though working in the firehouse will be an adjustment for Mr. Johnson, he has the resilience and capacity to make it work. With further training and experience in fire science, we believe Mr. Johnson will prove himself to be a competent and capable career firefighter and paramedic. In summation, we would recommend that Mr. Johnson be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Bolingbrook. ERL/\"',\n",

e2 80 9d Mild-mannered and cooperative in all phases of his assessment, but came across as a bit overwhelmed Came across as low-keyed, sincere, and congenial; not much impact Although his physical size is imposing, this individual may have trouble conveying an authoritative or credible presence as a police officer  y  : Although rated as e2 80 9cacceptable e2 80 9d on this dimension, this candidate is not a very outgoing or gregarious person; prefers to keep to himself Rates very low on our measures of extraversion and agreeableness However, he came across as polite and amiable during his interview Low needs for inclusion and acceptance from others On his behalf, he has been able to thrive in various military and paramilitary organizations comfortably throughout his career Expected to get along amicably with his fellow officers, but will not call much attention to himself    : Scored below average on our measures of altruism Conversely, this individual has spent his entire working life in service to his country and to the community as a soldier and fire-medic Feels good about himself when he is able to make a positive impact on the lives of others Looks forward to the more e2 80 9cproactive e2 80 9d nature of police work, as well as the variety and activity he anticipates in law enforcement The stability, benefits, and ary involved in a good public safety job are also important to this   relevant work and life experience  : Honorably discharged from the U.S. Army in 2010 after seven years of service with the rank of Sergeant (E-5) Two combat tours to Afghanistan and Iraq in 2005 and 2008; served as a forward observer with artillery and infantry units No college coursework whatsoever beyond high school Certified as a Firefighter II and EMT-B Since June of 2013, the  has been employed as a firefighter by the Gary Fire Department   : Consistently employed in some capacity since his high school years Determined, persistent, and disciplined in his basic work habits Always wearing a curious smile on his face; positive attitude Low needs for achievement, but high needs for competence and the quality of his work Expected to be a reliable, dependable, and consistent employee    : Spent his entire working life in military and paramilitary organizations Likes the rigor, discipline, and structure involved in public safety work In part we believe he is most comfortable in these types of organizations because of the unfairness and continued disdain he experiences with his step-father who has been very critical of him since childhood Follows the rules; will adhere to departmental policies and procedures Compliant and accommodating; will be respectful and obedient in his interactions with his superiors  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : To be certain, this individual has faced his share of stress and pressure in the line of duty as a soldier and fire-medic Tends to be mission and task-focused Will take necessary action in terms of maneuvers and tactics, but will have the most difficulty with his presentation and ability to project a command presence in a comfortable way Lacks impact and an authoritative bearing, but will fare well in customer and community service calls In hostile encounters, we have concerns about this candidate e2 80 99s reaction to high stress situations which may trigger suppressed symptoms of PTSD (see )    : Open and very candid in reporting some of the regrets and disappointments he has had in his life thus far Able to acknowledge his own contribution to most of the problems and setbacks he has endured Began assuming responsibility for himself and his actions at an early age due to circumstances in his family life Admitted some experimentation with marijuana in high school; rarely consumes alcohol No brushes with law enforcement Owns his own home and appears to be financially responsible    : Concerns about candidate e2 80 99s emotional stability and self-image Stated that his self-esteem has been e2 80 9clow e2 80 9d for as long as he can remember which he masks behind a near constant smile Likely to personalize the negativity and resistance encountered in police work, and unlikely to talk about it  has suffered in relative silence for over 10 years in his attempts to cope with traumatic experiences sustained in the Middle East as a soldier Test results indicate that he harbors a great deal of thinly suppressed anger and resentment Prone toward prolonged periods of worry and depression Although he has been able to cope with the routine stresses of being a medic and occasional firefighter, we believe this  is unprepared and not psychologically equipped to adapt and cope with the stresses of a policing career  Although he is well-built and in good physical shape, this  does not convey a very authoritative or capable presence on . Secondly, this individual tends to keep to himself despite his amiable and mild-mannered demeanor. Some concerns about his ability to fit in and collaborate with his fellow officers. Most importantly, this individual still experiences symptoms of PTSD e2 80 93 some of which are enduring and others episodic. Although he minimized these symptoms, we believe they could possibly lead to officer and citizen safety concerns, as well as difficulties adapting to the rough and tumble world of law enforcement (see ).   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Jordan provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background which included most essential details and a bit of elaboration when it was helpful. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this  demonstrated average writing ability despite some carelessness with capitalization and spelling errors. The candidate was attentive to most details, wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, and used proper grammar and syntax most of the time. As might be said about his appearance, this  will need some guidance and mentoring regarding the importance of professionalism in his attire and report writing. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Jordan to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his occupational accomplishments, and by his scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above. Mr. Jordan graduated from Lake Central High School in 2003 with a reported 2.90 GPA. In addition to an admittedly stressful family life, this  sustained a ruptured spleen on the football playing field when he was a junior which required ICU treatment and prolonged rehabilitation. Due to the tension in his family, Mr. Jordan promptly enlisted in the Army upon graduating. Since his discharge in 2010, Mr. Jordan has not taken any college level coursework whatsoever. Nevertheless, this  has the ability to master the essential information required of a police officer. However, we have concerns about just how well he will be able to apply that information in the actual performance of his duties due to some of his personality characteristics documented throughout this report.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Jordan to be a marginal candidate for the position in question, as he received unfavorable ratings on three of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. Although this individual is no stranger to high stress situations as a combat veteran and Gary Firefighter, we have concerns about how well he has been able to adapt and cope with some of the tragedies and horrors he has witnessed and endured over the years. According to Mr. Jordan, he has been afflicted with symptoms of PTSD since 2007 after being stationed in Iraq where his unit sustained heavy casualties. He reportedly sought some help for the condition while he was still on active duty, but he has not been the recipient of any kind of treatment or counseling since his discharge. Mr. Jordan maintained that he still feels depressed at times, but added that it is not really an issue for him despite the fact that whenever he hears a loud e2 80 9cpop e2 80 9d or e2 80 9ccrack e2 80 9d it takes him a few minutes to reorient and relax. This  also suffers from sleep apnea, and he appeared to be a bit tired and sleepy during his time at our office. Furthermore, Mr. Jordan does not seem to be very realistic or objective about what will be required of him as a police officer. Even though he reportedly has a couple of friends who are local police officers, he has never accompanied any of them on a ride-along, and he seemed a bit na c3 afve about the essential job functions he will be required to perform. When asked if he could do whatever he wanted to do with his life, Mr. Jordan flatly stated that he would like to become a personal trainer, which we believe would be a very good fit for this individual. We believe that the increased ary, job security, and benefits offered by the CCPD far outweigh what he is receiving in Gary as a firefighter and medic, and that is the primary reason he is seeking the position in question, as he has not applied to any other police agency whatsoever. Although he has been able to function as a firefighter and medic in a troubled urban environment for the past three years, we have concerns about Mr. Jordan e2 80 99s stability and capacity to cope with the gun violence and unexpected sounds and circumstances that may very well cause his suppressed combat trauma to resurface. Even if it takes him e2 80 9ca few minutes e2 80 9d to compose himself after a trigger-like situation, his life and the lives of others can hang in the balance. While we credit him for pushing through the turmoil and horrors he experienced in service of his country, it would be inadvisable to place him in similar high stress situations. We would wholeheartedly recommend that Mr. Jordan avail himself to the services offered by the Veterans Administration or private practitioners and specialists to address this matter in order to improve the quality of his life overall. In summation we are unable to recommend Mr. Jordan for a position as a Police Officer with the Calumet City Police Department. \"',\n",

In particular, Ms. Kaminski was attentive to all of the important details, and wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences using proper grammar and syntax. In sum, Ms. Kaminski e2 80 99s written communication skills are amongst her strongest attributes qualifying this candidate for the job in question. This should not be surprising given her mastery level performance on the  section of the . Paperwork and written reports are often developmental needs for entry-level police officers, yet this should not be the case with Ms. Kaminski.

Overall, we evaluate Ms. Kaminski to possess the proper thinking skills for the role.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Kaminski to be an acceptable  for the position in question. Raised in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Ms. Kaminski has been pointing toward a career in law enforcement since high school. During that time in her life, she joined a Police Explorer Post. At a local community college, Northeast Wisconsin Technical College, Ms. Kaminski enrolled in classes for criminal justice as well as fire science and EMS. This was because her first paying job in public safety involved playing a dual role in police and fire. From there, Ms. Kaminski relocated to the Chicago area, where she performed a series of security jobs for the company formerly known as Levy Security. Her assignments included postings at a gated community along with a medical center with multiple locations. At present, the candidate is employed as a police officer on a college campus. Ms. Kaminski has proven that she can perform in the role of a police officer. She has assisted with arrests and detentions. While not afraid to exert force if necessary, the  is also adept at talking people down from situations where they might harm themselves or others. On the other hand, Ms. Kaminski would serve herself and her employer better by learning to be friendlier and show her positive emotions. We believe that the candidate is capable for doing so, but she will require encouragement from her supervisors and FTO e2 80 99s. Regardless, in light of our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Ms. Kaminski be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Lindenhurst. \"',\n",

Name: Brandon Kneller Position: Police Officer Age: 25 Department: Police Department Date: November 12, 2019     : Conscientious about the testing process, followed instructions well, and worked within the expressed timelines Punctual, checked in half an hour early for his assessment Appropriately attired in a suit and tie for his appointment at our office Possesses a deep-sounding tone of voice; able to project a credible police presence  y  : Personable and outgoing High energy and extremely extraverted Expressive way of communicating his thoughts and ideas Talkative, to the point that certain people might find this individual to be verbose Has few filters on his words; straightforward and open about his views and his opinions Outspoken disposition might not be appreciated by the  e2 80 99s more experienced officers in the department Given his cavalier attitude about certain aspects of law enforcement, he will probably struggle to integrate effectively with his peers    : Believes that law enforcement is his e2 80 9ccalling e2 80 9d Wants to engage with the members of the community, which is supported by his high score on our measure of gregariousness; he enjoys the company of others Although he scored high on our measure of altruism, he made little mention of wanting to serve the public However, there is no question that this particular candidate has other compelling reasons for wanting to become a sworn police officer; he possesses a thrill-seeking personality As such, he is very much drawn to the action, variety, and excitement associated with the position in question  relevant work and life experience  : B.S. degree earned in 2017 from Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, where he majored in criminal justice Performed an internship with Henry County in Newcastle, Indiana; held the position of a Reserve Deputy Sheriff According to the candidate, he had e2 80 9cfull law enforcement powers e2 80 9d and worked 40 or more hours a week This meant riding in a police cruiser and carrying a weapon, to include a Taser States that he received in-house training similar to the Indiana State Police Academy in order to perform his duties as a Reserve Deputy Sheriff   : As with many thrill-seekers, this person shows all of the signs of selective motivation In short, he is interested primarily in the exciting parts of the job The  acknowledged being bored when assigned to the slow midnight shift with Henry County Sheriff e2 80 99s Department in Newcastle, Indiana To help fight boredom, the candidate claims that he frequently checked his cellphone and talked with coworkers who were not busy on the shift The  also noted that he has been asked to focus his attention better and not be so subject to outside distractions, which is another aspect of a thrill-seeking personality    : The  admits that he is stubborn and inclined to e2 80 9cpushback e2 80 9d again his superiors Scored low on our measure of compliance; more likely to compete rather than to cooperate Besides likely to be insubordinate, this person also pursues the easiest way to get a job done Hence, he is likely to be seen by his superior officers as a corner-cutter, one who is on the lookout for shortcuts in order to avoid doing the required work Possesses high needs for control, and he will not appreciate having others giving him orders In sum, this person is not a good fit for a paramilitary organization like a municipal police agency  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : This individual brazenly admitted that he disliked writing tickets as a reserve deputy sheriff in Henry County, Indiana His reasoning is that e2 80 9che e2 80 99s a speeder, e2 80 9d so why should he be a hypocrite Hence, his preference will be to gravitate toward the action, such as domestic disputes and other potentially violent crime on the streets Scored high on our measures of assertiveness which bodes well for the ability to act; our concern is that he will pick and choose what is convenient and relevant    : This candidate lacks maturity In his behalf, the  acknowledged that he always wanted to be a police officer; as a result, he has never been arrested or used any kind of illegal drugs Moreover, he was perfectly honest in expressing his outspoken views on a number of topics At the same time, the  e2 80 99s admitted stubborn side will make him resistant to hearing constructive feedback aimed at improving his job performance Currently lives at home with his parents, but he has been in a nine-month relationship with a woman he met on an on-line dating platform He has no outstanding debt; however, his parents paid for his entire college education, and his father is paying his car loan while the candidate contributes to his car insurance; at the age of 25 he is still quite financially dependent on his parents    : Because he possesses a thrill-seeking personality, he will experience problems on the job, especially due to boredom during his first couple of years More than likely, he will be assigned to an undesirable shift such as midnights; easily bored, he will probably resort to using his personal device to keep him awake like he did as a reserve officer On a personal note, he has had to cope with a lot of family stress as his mother has battled serious illnesses for a number of years He has no maladaptive behaviors to derail his focus and career; alcohol consumption is minimal To relax, he enjoys hanging out with friends, reading, shooting at the range, playing video games, and watching movies  This candidate e2 80 99s shortcomings are inherent to his personality and cannot be easily mitigated by training With little reason to recommend this individual, we will not offer any suggestions or recommendations for further training and development        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Kneller submitted a Personal History Form that was reasonably accurate but lacked sufficient detail and information. To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, Mr. Kneller employed proper spelling and grammar. We also administered two other writing samples, which included a mock police report as well as a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the  e2 80 99s career in law enforcement. On both of these exercises, this  demonstrated less than acceptable writing ability. In particular, while this person paid attention to using appropriate grammar and syntax, his material lacked pertinent details. As seen by his above-reported score on the  portion of the , this candidate has the capacity to write well. On the other hand, because he is selectively motivated, Mr. Kneller will not devote the proper amount of time and attention to performing paperwork and report writing. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. Regardless, Mr. Kneller is more absorbed with his own needs to be in tune with the needs and concerns of other people; hence, we do not see him possessing emotional intelligence to any significant degree.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Kneller to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. As our report reads, this person is unsuitable for the job. We are worried about the  e2 80 99s attitude, to include his unacceptable work habits that will be at variance with the demands and requirements of the hiring agency, the Bolingbrook Police Department. Selectively motivated, this thrill-seeking individual is an action-junkie, who is excited about a career in law enforcement for all of the wrong reasons. By his own admission, he is easily bored as well as distracted, which resulted in him using his cellphone for entertainment when the  was assigned to the very slow midnight shift in Henry County, Indiana. Having served in the capacity of a reserve deputy sheriff in this same agency, which entitled the candidate to carry a weapon and operate a police cruiser, we suspect that Mr. Kneller sees himself as ready to hit the street running. We are also bothered by the  e2 80 99s highly selective attitude towards enforcement. In particular, he dislikes the idea of writing traffic citations for speeding, since he himself breaks the law consistently by driving in excess of the posted speed limits. This kind of immature, self-focused attitude has no place in a municipal police agency. Therefore, in light of our highly cautious review, we would not recommend that Mr. Kneller be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Bolingbrook. \"',\n",

Name: Jonathon Kolosky Position: Police Officer Age: 27 Department: Police Department Date: June 6, 2019     : Tall, solidly-built individual; the candidate will present a credible police presence Professionally attired in a suit and tie for his appointment at our office Easy to engage in conversation Based on both his physical presence and engaging disposition, we believe that the members of the public will perceive the  as authoritative and approachable  y  : This candidate has a charismatic way about him He will be viewed as friendly and outgoing as well as likeable Presently employed by the Village of Lisle in their Police Department, and he only had favorable things to say about his fellow employees As such, we see him as an upbeat and positive person The fact that the Lisle Police Department has employed this person for the last four and a half years puts them in an ideal position to corroborate our observations about the candidate    : The opportunity to work alongside e2 80 9ca great group of people e2 80 9d is what appeals to the  regarding the job in question The fact that the candidate was raised in the community makes him eager to serve the Village of Lisle as a full-time, sworn police officer The candidate likes the fact that law enforcement is considered a respectable career Overall, he is looking for a steady job that benefits the public in some way  relevant work and life experience  : The candidate minored in criminal justice at Carthage College, where he graduated in 2014 That same year, 2014, the  was able to secure an e2 80 9cunofficial e2 80 9d internship with the Milwaukee (Wisconsin) Police Department For the last four years, the candidate has been employed in the capacity of a CSO (Community Service Officer) for the Village of Lisle Finally, he is a lifelong resident of the community and familiar with the surroundings   : Rates relatively high on our measures of conscientiousness, and in particular, his willingness to follow the rules and procedures This person has proven to be a loyal and dedicated employee as supported by the fact that he has been a CSO for the Village of Lisle for more than four years, since February of 2015 With his positive , the candidate half-kidded that he has been nicknamed, e2 80 9csmiling Jon e2 80 9d by his fellow employees at the Lisle Police Department Hardworking by nature, the candidate claims that he puts in approximately 50 hours a week at his job    : Raised with a healthy respect for those in positions of authority This person has never been arrested He has never been disciplined or terminated for cause at any of his prior jobs This person responds well to praise for a job well done Because of his familiarity with the Lisle Police Department, the  would appreciate having more autonomy than the average new hire at the agency The candidate is not comfortable with close supervision or micromanagement  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : To date, the  has had the unenviable role of administering parking tickets for the Lisle Police Department This person is courteous and polite to the members of the public, offering them the option of contesting their parking citations in a court of law He is able to hold firm, but the  added that he uses discretion when writing citations if there are extenuating circumstances due to either age or financial hardship Earlier in his tenure with the Lisle Police Department this individual was sent for time-management training so that he could learn to plan and prioritize his work more effectively We believe that this special training will help him when he is asked to multi-task on duty in a police cruiser    : The  can be expected to hold himself accountable for his actions without looking to make excuses for his behavior Despite his mature and well-behaved track record, the  does acknowledge using marijuana at least 20 times in college; his last usage was over 8 years ago in 2011 On the other hand, this person limits his consumption of alcohol to no more than two drinks of his favorite liquor, bourbon For the past year he has been married to a woman he dated for more than eight years; she works as an assistant manager in a fitness studio Both on and off the job, we anticipate that the  will act responsibly    : Having spent four years in the Lisle Police Department, the  is fully aware of his surroundings should he be hired as a full-time, sworn officer His duties and responsibilities will change significantly as will the element of danger; however, we believe that this person has a firm grasp of his new role and will respond to the challenge in a capable fashion His primary outlet for relieving tension and stress is to exercise along with his wife at the fitness studio she helps manage Finally, he spends less than a couple of hours a week playing videogames for relaxation  Since this individual is familiar with the agency, his learning curve should be relatively flat, except for his expanded duties on the street On the other hand, based on our observations of his written communication skills, the  will probably require closer monitoring of his paperwork and reports in order to make sure that they contain sufficient detail and information        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Kolosky did a nice job of providing accurate information on his Personal History Form. On the other hand, the level of detail offered on this same document was minimal at best. We also administered two other writing samples (both of which were typewritten). On each of these exercises, this  demonstrated minimally acceptable writing ability despite his strong showing on the  section of the . In particular, the candidate was not especially attentive to the details. Specifically, his mock police report was disappointing considering the fact that Mr. Kolosky has had an opportunity to observe police reports in his capacity as a CSO with the Lisle Police Department. In his favor, however, Mr. Kolosky wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences and used the proper grammar and syntax. Still, because of the importance of police reports, we would advise that the  e2 80 99s paperwork be closely monitored during his probationary period at the agency. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Kolosky to possess the proper thinking skills as well as the empathy and compassion to perform the essential elements associated with the duties and responsibilities connected with the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Kolosky to be a more than acceptable  for the position in question. As a current employee in the Lisle Police Department, the agency has had ample opportunity to watch Mr. Kolosky on a day-to-day basis. The candidate commented that he has been given the moniker of e2 80 9csmiling Jon, e2 80 9d which is no surprise to us in light of how we see him as a positive person as well as viable candidate for the role. As our report reveals, Mr. Kolosky is a strong candidate based on a number of important dimensions associated with the job in question in terms of both his  along with his conscientious work habits. We expect the  to project an authoritative presence to the public, while also acting in a courteous and polite fashion. Meanwhile, the  will also be perceived as approachable. At the same time, we are bothered by what we observed as less than detailed written communication skills, which could have negative implications for Mr. Kolosky e2 80 99s handling of the paperwork and report writing aspects of the position in question. Fortunately, writing skills can be improved by training, just as Mr. Kolosky e2 80 99s time-management skills were after training and coaching during his time as a CSO with the Lisle Police Department. Therefore, in light of our overall favorable review of this individual, we would recommend that Mr. Kolosky be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Lisle. \"',\n",

strikes us as a little rough around the edges In time, however, he will prove that he can get along acceptably with people both inside and outside of the agency    : Despite any anticipated struggles to integrate with others initially, the opportunity to interact with a wide variety of people in the community draws the candidate to a career in law enforcement Looks forward to making people e2 80 9chappier e2 80 9d and brightening their day when they need help and assistance Hopes to contribute to positive change in how police officers are currently viewed by the public and in the media The thrills and excitement of the job are extremely appealing to the ;

has held the position of a pretrial services officer and electronic monitoring officer Part of his duties in Kane County have involved monitoring the movements of offenders While most of his work with Kane County was behind a desk, he did occasionally get out into the field as part of his job responsibilities   : Has been gainfully employed since high school, when he worked alongside his father as a carpenter and later held a variety of entry-level jobs in the food services industry Has enjoyed his time with Kane County since graduating from college, but is seeking more challenge, activity, and responsibility in a future job Rates high on our measures of conscientiousness, especially his eagerness to advance in rank and responsibility Possesses a positive attitude toward his work and is unlikely to align with any malcontents who may exist within the police department    : While tension exists between the candidate and his father due to years of alcoholism, he has still demonstrated and maintained a healthy respect for those in positions of authority Reports no terminations from any previous place of work, neither has he received any disciplinary actions Candidate does have high needs for control, and this will be apparent in his observable preference to be in charge In keeping with our  about his loud and straightforward manner, the candidate has been cautioned by his past and present supervisors to keep his opinions to himself In this regard, we believe he will tend to express himself, but also understands the importance of the chain-of-command and will respond respectfully and accordingly  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Most of the confrontations he has encountered while working at the Court Services Department in Kane County have been verbal in nature This person is sensitive to offenders; citing, for example, that he avoids strapping ankle bracelets on offenders in front of their families, and especially their children The few times that he has gone e2 80 9chands-on e2 80 9d in his job, it was to break up fights and stop an inmate from committing suicide in the il As a former wrestler, he knows how to defend himself, but it is not his nature to want to prove to other people that he can hold his own in a physical confrontation Expected to be balanced, firm, and fair when enforcing laws and ordinances    : Arrested for vandalism at age 17, and admits to smoking marijuana about ten times e2 80 93 all before seriously considering a career in law enforcement Has learned from his past behavior and matured considerably since that time Prides himself on being the designated driver when out with his friends, and generally prefers to keep his consumption of alcohol within reasonable limits Overall, a self-aware individual, which predicts positively for hearing constructive feedback without becoming defensive Holds himself accountable for his actions; not inclined to make excuses for his behavior    : Has demonstrated that he finishes what he starts; this has been true in school and at work Weathered a difficult divorce between his parents when he was a child, and a joint custody situation that required him to be uprooted on a weekly basis Presently engaged, and enjoys a solid support group of friends To combat tension and stress, the  exercises seven times a week  Caution about voicing his views to his superiors, especially when he is acclimating to the department during his probationary period Monitoring of his paperwork and written reports to make sure that they contain all of the necessary and relevant information   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Kubat printed neatly and legibly. We administered two writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On both of his exercises, this  demonstrated reasonably acceptable writing ability, writing in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, and utilizing the proper grammar and syntax. Although our perspective, the candidate could have been more attentive to the details. He did provide neat and organized responses, yet due to his tendency to get to the point, Mr. Kubat may need some reminders to explain and elaborate so his police reports are complete and detailed. Mr. Kubat e2 80 99s scores on the tests cited above are all within acceptable ranges of performance. The candidate obtained his associate e2 80 99s degree over a period of five years while working throughout and persisted towards the completion of his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in 2016. His grades have always been above average, and his ability to learn and adapt in many different roles leads us to believe that Mr. Kubat possesses the necessary cognitive abilities to learn and master the essential elements pertaining to the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Kubat to be an acceptable  for the position in question. While his initial impression might strike certain people as reflective of a candidate who is a little rough around the edges with his loud voice and direct way of expressing himself, he possesses all of the proper attributes to perform the job. This individual is hard working and responsible. In spite of his observed shortcomings, he is able to accept these potential problems and hear feedback on his performance and its impact on other people. This kind of self-awareness will be very important when the candidate is on the receiving end of constructive criticism during his probationary period. As stated previously in this report, Mr. Kubat has overcome some significant challenges during his childhood from a divorced home and his father battling with alcoholism. This individual respects authority and responds well to direction despite the struggles with his parents. In his behalf, he focused his efforts on gaining the education and experience to work in a law enforcement setting. Finally, he is reasonably bright and able to catch on fairly quickly when trained properly. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Kubat be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Hoffman Estates. \"',\n",

Name: cob Lackovic Position: Firefighter Age: 25 Department: Fire Department Date: October 18, 2019     : Finished his pre-assessment work around 9:30 pm the day before his appointment, pushing the boundary for the timeline specified in his initiation email for 12 hours prior However, he was punctual for appointment at our office Less than clean-cut, with a ponytail that was tucked behind his head His casual and rebellious-looking personal appearance may cause some members of the public to question his preparedness for the job Neatly dressed in a suit with a string tie Rather talkative and seemed anxious about the assessment process  y  : Generally pleasant and polite manner While private and selective in his interactions with most people, there is a talkative side to his disposition which will likely emerge when the candidate is feeling uncomfortable in the presence of others This same selectivity will dictate whether he gets along with his fellow firefighters; may have some difficulty forging comfortable and genuine relationships with his peers Scored low on our measure of gregariousness; will not seek and is likely to avoid social stimulation which could make the close confines of the firehouse more difficult Rather self-absorbed; will likely place his needs ahead of those of others He resents any kind of a coworker who causes him to do extra work Admits that he will raise his voice in protest to people who put extra demands on him in the workplace Scored low on our measure of compliance and will prefer to compete rather than cooperate    : This person pays lip service to wanting to help other people and serve the community, however, we observed other compelling reasons motivating the candidate to seek this job According to the candidate, it e2 80 9cseems cool e2 80 9d to run into a burning building and emerge with a person, or even a treasured pet In short, he is drawn to the excitement of the job The  also repeated several times during his assessment interview that he is e2 80 9cfascinated with the human body, e2 80 9d which is in line with his field of study e2 80 93 exercise science Rates lower on our measures of altruism; self-centered and more reluctant to get involved in the problems of others On his written forms, he stated that is loooking for the following things in a job: good co-workers, benefits, and good pay, along with room to improve and develop his skills; a list of items that serve or benefit him instead of the community    : B.S. degree in exercise science from the University of Mississippi earned in May of 2017 At present this person is enrolled at Elite Ambulance to earn his EMT-B certification Other than his current enrollment in EMT-B classes, the candidate has no other education or relevant like experience related to the fire service and EMS According to the candidate, his only other exposure to serious injury was on the rugby field Has worked as a barista which requires multi-tasking and the ability to remember many formulas; has some customer service experience   : While well-intended and likeable in many ways, this individual is still searching to find himself Since graduating from college, the candidate has tried different jobs from the head rugby coach at Northwestern University to a manual laborer, pulling pipes and cable None of these jobs has lasted more than a year or more In his behalf, he has been flexible and adaptable in responding to requests from his past and present bosses    : Despite his rebellious-looking personal appearance e2 80 93 a ponytail and by the  e2 80 99s admission, a scruffy beard that was shaved for his appointment at our office e2 80 93 this person has not had any major clashes with those in positions of authority The  states that he has never been arrested In addition, he has never been terminated from any previous place of work, nor has he been disciplined by his prior bosses and supervisors On the other hand, because he anticipates making mistakes in any new job, the candidate does not want to report to a supervisor who e2 80 9cgets mad at him e2 80 9d    : This individual rates exceptionally low on our measures of deliberation; may be prone to acting without considering all of the consequences By his own admission, the  acknowledges that he acts impulsively and has received criticism for his reckless actions from his superiors For example, in his current job as a laborer, he will often start digging holes before he has carefully thought things through At the scene of a fire or medical emergency this kind of behavior can have disastrous implications Moreover, with absolutely no practical experience in fire science or EMS, it is even more difficult to determine how the  will perform under pressure    : This person e2 80 99s main passion is rugby; has both played the sport and later coached it for a short while While this person assumed responsibility for his past mistakes, such as smoking marijuana under peer pressure, he still strikes us as immature, even for 25 years old As noted above, this individual is still searching for the right choice of career Presently lives with his girlfriend; however, the couple resides with her parents because both have too many financial obligations that need to be paid    : With the amount of job-hopping that this person has done to date, it is hard to envision him remaining with the fire service for a suitable length of time Still looking to find his niche, we anticipate that the  will be on his journey for several more years As noted, this person has a number of financial obligations weighing on him; more than $100,000 in student loans, credit cards, and a car loan Enjoys rugby which will help with relaxation and relieving stress He also enjoys photography and lifting weights in his spare time Special Training, Orientation & Concerns This person is not yet ready for a career as a full-time fire medic; he needs significant training and hands-on experience.        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Lackovic submitted a Personal History Form that was reasonably accurate but lacking sufficient detail. Earlier we spoke about the  e2 80 99s selectivity, and we believe that when it comes to routine and mundane administrative chores, like paperwork and report writing, Mr. Lackovic will show less effort and interest in such tasks. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the  e2 80 99s career. To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, Mr. Lackovic demonstrated acceptable writing ability while paying attention to the appropriate grammar and syntax. On this particular exercise, likely because he was discussing one of his favorite topics, himself, Mr. Lackovic showed a higher attention to the pertinent details. There is no question that Mr. Lackovic is bright as evidenced by his above-reported scores on the . In addition, the  is a college graduate. All things considered, the candidate has the ability to master the essential information and skills required for the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Lackovic to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. Despite a preponderance of marginal ratings, there is a lot that we like personally about this individual. To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he is an open and sincere person. While he seemed a little ill-at-ease during the interview portion of the assessment process, he gave an honest account of himself, including both his strengths and limitations. At no time did he try to make excuses for himself. On the other hand, his fit for the job in question is a doubtful one. At present, he has yet to even complete the most basic of EMS training courses aimed at earning his EMT certification. Mr. Lackovic has never worked for a private ambulance company or been a volunteer or a paid-on-call firefighter. Moreover, he has never had exposure to a fire cadet program. Coupled with such little training and exposure to the demands of the fire service a lack of deliberation and instead an impulsive nature, the learning curve will be extensive for this individual. For this person, his passion since college has been playing and later coaching rugby. The jobs that he has held after graduating from the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi, have been short-term in nature and lacking in a consistent career path. Wanting to pursue a career in the fire service and EMS, the  spoke with his father who suggested that he follow in the footsteps of his uncle. Mr. Lackovic e2 80 99s uncle is a firefighter with the Village of Huntley, Illinois. We suspect that Mr. Lackovic will continue to drift in his career, and hiring him as a full-time fire medic is a risk which we would not advise taking at the present time. Therefore, in light of our stated concerns and reservations, we would not recommend that Mr. Lackovic be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Matteson. \"',\n",

Below Average Average Above Average Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Apprai Test (assesses logical reasoning skills & ability to make critical evaluations of arguments & assumptions) Norms for Police Officers BELOW AVERAGE BELOW AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Lazarescu provided a straightforward and detailed account of his personal and professional background, which also included a bit of elaboration when it was necessary to make a point. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this  demonstrated average to above average writing ability, as he consistently expressed himself in clear and complete sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Mr. Lazarescu has the capacity to produce informative and professional reports and documentation as a police officer. Despite his lower than average score on our standardized test of critical thinking, we evaluate Mr. Lazarescu to possess at least average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his educational accomplishments and grades to date, and by the way he was able to express his thoughts and ideas (orally and on paper) during his assessment. Mr. Lazarescu graduated from Christian Liberty Academy in 2010 with a reported 4.50 (5.00 scale). During his high school years, he was involved in soccer, band, and student council, and he enjoyed working with others toward common goals and interests. Stating that his father and grandfather were both pastors and preachers, he enrolled at MBI where he majored in bible studies. He was awarded his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in that area in 2014, graduating with a reported 2.50 (4.00 scale) while working part-time throughout. In summation, this individual has the ability to master the essential information and skills required of a police officer.  Born and raised in Rolling Meadows, Mr. Lazarescu is the elder of two children. This candidate attended a private Christian school throughout his developmental years, and was involved in various activities offered by the school and his church. According to Mr. Lazarescu, his father and grandfather are both pastors and preachers, although his father is not currently assigned to a church and is working in es. While he was growing up, Mr. Lazarescu was told that he had a facility for preaching, and seemed implicit that he would follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. In fact, Mr. Lazarescu thought seriously about taking that direction upon enrolling at Moody Bible Institute in 2010. Thereafter, Mr. Lazarescu e2 80 99s interests started to change as he met his future wife, and he also signed on with Moody Public Safety as a part-time security officer. Both his e2 80 9cearly e2 80 9d marriage and his involvement with police work did not set well with his father, which caused a notable rift between them to this day. Nevertheless, Mr. Lazarescu is quite content and happy with his life, and he does not regret the decisions he has made. According to Mr. Lazarescu, he has always had an interest in the military, and he viewed himself as a e2 80 9cprotector e2 80 9d of those who could not or would not defend themselves. Consequently, he found public safety work to be a very good fit for him in his desire to be of meaningful assistance to others and the campus community where he still resides (because his wife remains a student at Moody). A hardworking and energetic individual, Mr. Lazarescu now envisions himself moving forward toward a policing career, and looks forward the mental and physical challenges that await him during his training and education in the field of law enforcement. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Lazarescu to be an acceptable  for the position in question, as he received either e2 80 9cacceptable e2 80 9d or e2 80 9cstrong e2 80 9d ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. In light of our favorable review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Lazarescu be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the The Moody Bible Institute Police Department. \"',\n",

Mr. Lazarescu graduated from Christian Liberty Academy in 2010 with a reported 4.50 GPA (5.00 scale). During his high school years, he was involved in soccer, band, and student council, and he enjoyed working with others toward common goals and interests. He was awarded his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in that area in 2014, graduating with a reported 2.50 GPA (4.00 scale) while working part-time throughout. We believe Mr. Lazarescu has the ability to perform and master the essential duties required of a police officer.  Born and raised in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, Mr. Lazarescu is the elder of two children. This candidate attended a private Christian school throughout his developmental years. According to Mr. Lazarescu, his father and grandfather are both pastors and preachers, and his parents recently moved to Idaho where his father was assigned to a church. While he was growing up, Mr. Lazarescu was told that he had a facility for preaching, and he thought seriously about taking that direction upon enrolling at Moody Bible Institute in 2010. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Lazarescu e2 80 99s interests started to change as he met his future wife, and he also signed on with Moody Public Safety as a part-time security officer. Mr. Lazarescu is quite content and happy with his life, and he does not regret the decisions he has made, especially in choosing to pursue a career in law enforcement. According to Mr. Lazarescu, he has always had an interest in the military, and he found public safety work to be a very good fit for him in his desire to be of meaningful assistance to others. A hardworking and energetic individual, Mr. Lazarescu now envisions himself being a part of a department that will foster his career as a police officer. He looks forward the mental and physical challenges that await him at a new department. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Lazarescu to be an acceptable  for the position in question, as he received either e2 80 9cacceptable e2 80 9d or e2 80 9cstrong e2 80 9d ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. Even so, the decision to offer the candidate employment as a police officer for the Village of Skokie is respectfully left to the discretion of the BOFPC. ERL/\"',\n",

On her behalf, she is able to stick her points with clarity and conviction despite her noticeable accent. Paperwork and report writing could stand some improvement in terms of grammar, syntax, and spelling. Overall, we expect this motivated and determined individual to be a pleasure to supervise.        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Ms. Lazic provided a neatly typed account of her personal and professional background, which was clear and comprehensive. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this  demonstrated average writing ability as she expressed herself in complete and coherent sentences. With English being her second language (which she essentially taught herself over the past eight years) there were several grammatical, spelling, and syntactical errors noted, which did not obscure her meaning or content. Nevertheless, this individual will need to continue to improve upon the development of her writing skills as it pertains to police reports and documentation. Overall, we evaluate Ms. Lazic to possess above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by her academic and occupational experiences to date, and the wealth of life experience she brings to the position. With only a high school diploma when she arrived in the U.S. eight years ago, Ms. Lazic delighted in the chance to finally further her formal education, which was not possible in Serbia because of the cost of tuition. In 2018, Ms. Lazic applied herself diligently in her attainment of two associate e2 80 99s degree from Moraine Valley Community College and her grades were excellent. Whatever she may lack in terms of innate intellectual ability, she will make up for in determination and persistence. Ms. Lazic has the ability to master the essential information and skills required to become a police officer.  Ms. Lazic was born and raised in Serbia and remains fluent in that language, as well as, Croatian and Bosnian. Growing up in a war-torn country with little financial support, Ms. Lazic lamented that she wanted to become a police officer at an early age, but only men could pursue policing careers in her home country. Married for the past eight years to a man she met when she was 12 years old, Ms. Lazic could not be happier or more appreciative of the opportunities she has taken advantage of since arriving in the U.S. in 2011 without knowing much English. This emotionally durable  lived through some significant hardships and disappointments, but has remained positive and resilient in the face of obstacles and tough times. We believe that quality will manifest itself during her training and education as a police officer. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Lazic to be an acceptable  for the position in question, as she received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. By no means a e2 80 9ctraditional e2 80 9d candidate for an entry-level police officer position in terms of her age and background, we believe this energetic, determined, and highly motivated individual brings a lot to the job in terms of her relational skills, life experience, and emotional and social intelligence. To punctuate her seriousness and about taking on the challenges of a law enforcement career, Ms. Lazic is currently on at least 15 hiring lists for various police jobs throughout the Chicago area. While some may underestimate her because of her size and stature, this mature individual is confident and assertive in stepping up to face challenges and critical situations, which he has done repeatedly throughout her personal and professional life. Furthermore, Ms. Lazic is a highly altruistic person, who looks forward to the opportunity to make a positive impact on the community and the lives of others through her diligence and devotion to duty. In light of our review of her personality characteristics and qualifications, we would recommend that Ms. Lazic be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Elmhurst, Illinois. \"',\n",

Below Average Average Above Average Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Apprai Test (assesses logical reasoning skills & ability to make critical evaluations of arguments & assumptions) Norms for Firefighters BELOW AVERAGE BELOW AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Lewis submitted a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background which included relevant details and a bit of elaboration whenever it was necessary. A man of few words, this individual tends to keep his written work concise and to the point. Moreover, he clearly demonstrated his ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Mr. Lewis has the ability to produce informative and professional reports and documentation as a firefighter and medic. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Lewis to possess average mental ability despite his lower than average score on our test of critical thinking (cited above). This assertion is supported by his educational and occupational accomplishments to date, and by the manner in which he was able to express his thoughts and ideas (orally and on paper) during his assessment. Mr. Lewis graduated from one of the better high schools within the Chicago Public School System in 2009 with a reported 3.20 grade point average. During his high school years, he earned some awards as a baseball player, and he wanted to continue his baseball career to the next level with the hope of someday playing professionally. Mr. Lewis also wanted to pursue a fire service career. Consequently, he accepted a partial baseball scholarship to Oakton Community College where he did play ball at the collegiate level for two seasons and went on to earn his associate e2 80 99s degree in 2015 graduating with a reported 2.50 GPA. All things considered, this serious and determined individual has the ability to master the essential information and skills to become a firefighter and medic.  The younger of two children, Mr. Lewis grew up on Chicago e2 80 99s south side where he attended local public schools. Raised with strong morals and values by his hardworking parents, this candidate kept his nose clean throughout his developmental years as he focused much of his energy toward the pursuit of a baseball career. A rather likable and affable individual, Mr. Lewis was a bit hard-pressed to herald any accomplishments or achievements in his life thus far, stating with a smile on his face that he is most proud of is becoming a responsible adult. According to Mr. Lewis, he decided to give up on his goal to play professional baseball even though he had been draft eligible by a few major league teams. As a result, he fully devoted his attention to developing his EMS skills with a plan to ultimately test for fire service jobs. Mr. Lewis originally became interested in the fire service through the influence and encounters he had with some of his father e2 80 99s friends who serve with the Chicago Fire Department. Drawn to the pride, professionalism, and mental and physical challenges involved in a fire service career, Mr. Lewis expressed enthusiasm and excitement about taking this next step in his career with the Hanover Park Fire Department. By his own admission, he does not know very much about Hanover Park, as he resided in the inner-city his entire life. Consequently, he will be exposed to an entirely different organizational culture and demographic than he has been accustomed to, not to mention the need to learn the streets and geography of the Village. We believe he is more than capable of overcoming these challenges, as Mr. Lewis struck us as a diligent and conscientious person, who will put forth the effort to get himself up to speed in all areas. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Lewis to be an above average  for the position in question despite his lack of fire service experience. Overall, we liked the balance he brings to the position in terms of his amiable and low-keyed interpersonal style and his strong task orientation and focus. Over time, we expect Mr. Lewis to develop into a positive and capable addition to the HPFD. In light of our favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Lewis be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Hanover Park, Illinois. \"',\n",

should work hard to achieve his goals    : The above-mentioned incident regarding the removal of his employer e2 80 99s confidential information certainly speaks to the  e2 80 99s issues with following the rules From an early age this individual was raised to both fear and resent authority According to the candidate, his father was quick to anger and not afraid to use his belt on the  Responds well to direct and straightforward leadership; in short, he needs to know where he stands with his superiors    : In his behalf, this person has performed acceptably thus far in his career as a fire medic Since he has only been employed in the fire service and EMS since the spring of this year, his exposure to emergencies and trauma have been rather limited In fact, he has mostly performed patient transport Feels that he is e2 80 9cprogrammed e2 80 9d to perform his job, and he is able to hold his emotions in check Also, in his favor is the fact that the  is fully bi-lingual, which has helped when he is administering care to patients who only speak Spanish    : This person has exercised some very questionable judgment earlier in his life Besides his above-mentioned arrest, the  indulged in using illegal drugs to the extreme According to the candidate, he calculates smoking marijuana in excess of 400 times His last usage of the illegal substance was as recent as last year, in 2018 In addition, the candidate has used a prescription drug, Adderall, that was not prescribed to him in order to stay up and study in college Finally, rather than hold himself accountable for his actions, he is inclined to make excuses for his bad behavior and poor decisions    : Appears to be able to cope with pressure and stress on the job Relies on exercise to help relieve tension and stress One of the ways that he seeks to dissipate his feelings of anger and hostility is by MMA fighting as well as practicing a wide variety of martial arts While his alcohol use is moderate, his history of drug use is extensive and the last use was in 2018, which is fairly recent This candidate is carrying a significant amount of debt, but there are mitigating circumstances that might make this burden less worrisome; his wife is employed in a lucrative profession applying make-up and styling hair for television and movie productions In his behalf, he has paid off his college loans, totaling around $15,000 Special Training, Orientation & Concerns This candidate e2 80 99s shortcomings are inherent to his personality and cannot be easily mitigated by training. Therefore, we will offer no recommendations for his development.        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Luis submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate and contained sufficient information and detail as well as making effective use of the proper spelling and grammar. We also administered another writing sample which is a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the  e2 80 99s career. The  demonstrated acceptable writing ability, and he also used the appropriate grammar and syntax. We were impressed with how Mr. Luis provided the pertinent details. There is no question that this candidate knows how to write as evidenced by his strong showing on the  section of the . All things considered, the candidate has the ability to master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. Regardless, we believe the candidate is lacking in his fundamental quality. Out for himself and to meet his own needs, it is hard for him to have empathy for other people.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Luis to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. Our report raised too many red flags about this individual. From his poor judgement in his excessive use of illegal drugs, to include smoking marijuana as recently as last year, to his arrest for misappropriating data from a former employer to suit his own interests, there is no question that this candidate is self-serving and out to satisfy his own needs ahead of other people. Even his interest in the fire service is driven largely by his exaggerated needs for thrills and excitement. According to the candidate, he has always had three goals in life, to become a firefighter, own a business, and become a police officer. The  e2 80 99s interest in owning and operating a business culminated with opening a gym with a partner. The candidate claims that his membership grew dramatically, but that his partner mishandled the finances of the enterprise, and it was forced to close. Mr. Luis e2 80 99s habit of blaming others for his setbacks and disappointments is a pattern that will play out in future jobs, to include while he is working in the fire service and EMS. Because of the candidate e2 80 99s identified character deficiencies, we think that it would be a mistake to hire him into the Department. Therefore, in light of our many stated concerns and reservations, we would not recommend that Mr. Luis be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Hanover Park. \"',\n",

we would agree with these reported descriptions Calm and level-headed; expected to utilize sound judgment and common sense in stressful situations    : Open and candid in reporting some of the regrets and disappointments he has had in his life, with the foremost one being his failed marriage and the related debt he accrued Was granted full custody of his two daughters over five years ago; asserted that he revolves his world around caring for his children Has seen a counselor a handful of times for PTSD symptoms related to his military experience; he reportedly learned to effectively cope with his symptoms Acknowledged his shortcomings and has tried to improve upon them Admitted to trying marijuana in high school; claims to rarely drink alcohol anymore as a result of his commitment to parenting his children No reported encounters with law enforcement    : Not much will deter this individual from attaining his goals and getting a job done Committed to his own mental health as well as the health and wellbeing of others Medically retired from the military after a decade of service; appears to be coping effectively with the stress of multiple tours and being struck by an IED in Afghanistan Talking things out with coworkers after difficult calls will be helpful for this individual Relies on the support of a few good friends and his close-knit family Enjoys a couple of recreational and social activities that help him relax outside of work, but most of all spending time with his daughters Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Ensuring the candidate will have resources and support available to address his PTSD when necessary. This candidate is eager to serve and trainable; expected to catch on quickly to the policies and procedures in a new department and carefully follow them. Will appreciate a supervisor who is sensitive about his military history and commitments to parenting.        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Lupo provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional life. Not only did he include the essential details, he also demonstrated a good level of clarity in his written work. Mr. Lupo expressed himself in complete sentences containing proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. We do not foresee this individual encountering difficulty producing professional and informative reports as a firefighter/paramedic. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Lupo to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his occupational accomplishments to date and by the manner in which he was able to express his thoughts and ideas during his assessment. Mr. Lupo graduated from Bolingbrook High School in 2004 with a reported 2.40 grade point average. While he was in high school, he participated in sports and decided during his sophomore year that he would pursue a military career. However, since retiring from the military, he has been committed to this newly chosen career path in the fire service and has successfully obtained a few relevant certifications. Overall, we believe Mr. Lupo will not have much difficulty mastering the essential information and skills required to become a firefighter and paramedic.  Growing up in suburban Bolingbrook, Mr. Lupo attended local public schools, and was raised by his parents to value working hard and not giving up. After his parents divorced while Mr. Lupo was in kindergarten, the candidate primarily lived with his mother, maternal half-brother, and identical twin brother, and also maintained a close relationship with his father. Upon graduating high school, the candidate was already intent upon joining the United States Marine Corps. The candidate mentioned to our administrative assistant that he actually had his parents sign off on his enlistment, as he had not yet turned eighteen years old at the time. According to Mr. Lupo, he enjoyed his time in the military, although he admittedly experienced some hardships and challenges during his decade of serving his country. After being struck by an IED during a deployment in Afghanistan, Mr. Lupo focused on his physical and mental rehabilitation. He ended his military career in 2014 to focus on parenting his two daughters and pursuing a civilian career as a firefighter/paramedic. Mr. Lupo is a dedicated father who wants to set a good example for his daughters and be able to provide for them. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Lupo to be an acceptable  for the position in question. We found Mr. Lupo to be a sincere, mature, and motivated candidate who will continue to apply himself in a diligent and dutiful manner in a new department. He is particularly committed to serving his community and is eager to earn a full-time career position as a firefighter/paramedic in his hometown of Bolingbrook. Mr. Lupo is a friendly and hardworking individual who will get along amicably with his peers and superiors over time. In addition to his military service, he has been employed as a contract firefighter/paramedic for over a year now and has obtained some relevant certifications for continuing his progress in the fire service. Therefore, in light of our favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Lupo be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Bolingbrook. ERL/\"',\n",

Name: Jose Mata Position: Police Officer Age: 29 Department: Police Department Date: August 14, 2019     : Neatly groomed and attired in a dress shirt and tie; polite and professional presentation Confident and straightforward in his delivery and communication style; good eye contact Came across as a bit overly confident at times; tended to minimize difficulties or shortcomings Strong customer service background showed in the way he carried himself Should be able to project an approachable and capable presence as a police officer  y  : Outgoing and engaging individual who will not hesitate to initiate interaction with others Generally agreeable, but will hold his own in a dispute or disagreement; tends to be rather opinionated on certain issues Low needs for inclusion and acceptance from others; some may find him to be a bit self-absorbed Large number of close and trusted friends Will make an effort to establish collaborative working relationships with his fellow officers    : Scored about average on our measures of altruism, but he has not extended himself to perform any type of volunteer or community service work in his life All of his reasons for pursuing a law enforcement career had to do with his personal needs for comfort and convenience With a bourgeoning family of four children, this  is interested in the ary, security, and benefits he anticipates with a good public safety job Also drawn to the opportunities for specialization, advancement, and supervision Within five years he hopes to be training recruits, which we found a bit presumptuous since he has never even been on a ride-along at the age of 29  relevant work and life experience  : Associate e2 80 99s degree in general studies from Heartland Community College in 2013 Employed as an assistant manager for Discount Tire from 2007 to 2016 Also worked part-time as a parts manager for AutoZone for about a year Presently employed as a truck driver for a supply company since October of 2016  has had absolutely no exposure to police work or police operations; not even a ride-along Most of his knowledge about police work reportedly comes from two friends who are presently serving as officers elsewhere   : To his credit, this  has been consistently employed since his senior year of high school However, his work habits have been less than stellar over the years in terms of tardiness, missed days, and compliance For example, he was terminated from Discount Tire in 2012 for erratic punctuality; felt that management was making an example of him Hired back shortly thereafter, but tardiness issues remained, and he was again disciplined in 2014 Also reprimanded for not following procedures; explained that he believed his way of doing things was easier for him Likely to bend rules and guidelines to suit his purposes    : Appears to have had positive relationships with most of the authority figures in his life beginning with his parents Complained about management (and coworkers) at his previous jobs regarding their ineptitude and inconsistency As stated above, this individual was no stranger to oral and written reprimands regarding the quality of his work habits e2 80 9cAlways wanted e2 80 9d the military; however, we have concerns about his self-discipline and capacity to adhere to the structure and rigor involved within a paramilitary organization Does not appear to be very open to constructive criticism or corrective feedback; feels he has a better way to do things  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Solid customer service background; knows how to deal with others in a congenial, respectful, and straightforward manner in his delivery Conversely, his persona may not reflect much sincerity in genuinely caring about the needs or concerns of others Responses to some routine enforcement scenarios during his interview conveyed questionable judgment and officer safety concerns As stated throughout this report, this candidate seems to have an inflated sense of his intellectual and physical prowess and capabilities Likely to be indifferent and inconsistent toward citizens in his enforcement of laws and ordinances    : Inordinate difficulty finding any shortcomings or weaknesses; minimized problems and setbacks Found fault with others, made excuses, or provided elaborate rationalizations when things did not go his way Although he has been consistently employed since high school and has been married for the past five years with his fourth child born two weeks ago, this individual seemed more focused on himself and his needs than anything else during his interview Some minor brushes with law enforcement eight years ago with one suspension of his driving privileges; denied any illicit drug use in his life On his behalf, he appears to be concerned about financially supporting his wife and children better, and he believes police work will allow him that opportunity    : Not much seems to bother this individual as he tends to minimize shortcomings or blame others when things do not go his way Does not seem to be prone toward prolonged periods of worry or anxiety Reportedly has a supportive base of family and a large circle of close and trusted friends Enjoys shooting and hunting as a means of relaxation A bit full of himself, this individual is not likely to personalize negativity or resistance  Seems to think he fully understands what will be expected of him as a police officer, which was not substantiated during the course of his interview. Concerns about this individual e2 80 99s repeated issues with tardiness and compliance despite sustained tenure with previous jobs. Does not quite get the discipline, rigor, and structure of life within a paramilitary organization. Inflated sense of his mental and physical abilities. Questionable judgment in dealing with routine enforcement scenarios. Likely to be difficult to supervise as he tends to be rather opinionated and condescending.        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Mata provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background which was well-written and contained bullet point responses. We also administered two other writing samples to Mr. Mata. In all exercises, this  demonstrated above average writing ability as he consistently expressed himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. As a side note however, we found this individual to be very self-congratulatory in heralding accomplishments, strengths, and positive attributes. Nevertheless, he has the ability to produce professional and informative reports as a police officer. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Mata to possess average to above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his educational and occupational accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. This bilingual (Spanish)  graduated from Argo High School in 2008 with a reported 2.80 GPA. A mechanically inclined individual, Mr. Mata was involved in sports and began working part-time his senior year. Although he wanted to join the military, Mr. Mata lamented that he never followed through. In 2011, his intent was to obtain his bachelor e2 80 99s degree from Illinois State, so he moved to the Bloomington-Normal area to attend a nearby community college where he earned an associate e2 80 99s degree in science, but he did not follow through with his plans for a bachelor e2 80 99s degree. On his behalf, Mr. Mata worked full-time throughout his college years. This  has the ability to master the essential information and skills required of a police officer. However, we have some concerns about his common sense and practical judgment in being able to apply what he has learned in a capable and effective manner in the actual performance of his duties.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Mata to be a marginal  for the position in question, as he received unacceptable ratings on five of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a police officer. According to Mr. Mata, he has been testing for selected police departments for the past year and one-half, but he was not very clear or convincing about his motivation for a law enforcement career other than saying e2 80 9cit was the next closest thing to the military. e2 80 9d At the age of 29, most of his employment history has involved managerial work in the automotive field, and he now drives a truck for a supply company. Seeking the security, benefits, and opportunities for advancement, this rather self-congratulatory individual sees himself on some type of fast track for promotion and supervision without ever having set foot inside a police station or gaining any related type of experience. We have significant concerns about his work habits, compliance, and self-absorbed interpersonal style. This individual has a rather inflated sense of his intellectual and physical capabilities, and we anticipate that he is likely to be difficult to supervise. Although he is reportedly currently being processed for hire by two different police departments, we would recommend that the department and Commission take a pass on Mr. Mata and continue to search for better prepared and more suitable recruits to serve with the Bolingbrook Police Department. \"',\n",

Name: Bryan Mazur Position: Firefighter Age: 21 Department: Fire Department Date: May 15, 2019     : Well-groomed with a presentable personal appearance Professionally attired for his appointment at our office, wearing a suit and tie Initially anxious about the assessment process; this was his first psychological exam Overall, he was open and honest, and gave an acceptable account of himself  y  : Pleasant and polite person who will show respect and consideration for his coworkers in the department Has a private and selective side to his disposition; will be friendly with his coworkers, but he is unlikely to form deep bonds of friendship with most peers More introverted than extraverted by nature, but he is looking forward to the family-like atmosphere in the firehouse Overall, this person equally enjoys working alone and participating as part of a team    : Helping people has the most appeal to this person of all of the elements associated with working in the fire service Stating that he leans toward a profession that relies on using more physical capacities than mental abilities is yet another drawing card for this line of work In keeping with this comment, the candidate appreciates functioning in a job where there is a heightened level of variety and excitement Finally, the convenient 24/48 schedule appeals to the  as well    : The candidate is currently studying for his associate e2 80 99s degree in fire science at McHenry Community College; at present he has accumulated between 50 and 60 credit hours Earned his EMT-B in 2017 from McHenry Community College in conjunction with Centegra Health Systems The  admits that he has no relevant hands-on experience related to the field other than his clinical time during his EMT-B training On the other hand, he has interfaced with customers and clientele at his two places of work; hence, he has learned how to adopt a service orientation   : Candidate is currently holding two jobs, both of which he has had for several years Employed by the Coon Creek Hunt Club in a variety of capacities since 2016, and he has worked in the store at TAZ Archery since 2014 While both of these jobs were attained through his father e2 80 99s connections, this person has been a loyal and dedicated employee The candidate can be expected to follow the rules Prides himself on his punctuality and the minimal amount of sick time he has used during his period of employment at both places of work    : Due in large part to his exceptionally close relationship with his father, this person was raised with a healthy respect for those in positions of authority Although he has had very few bosses to report to, this person has never encountered trouble with any of them For example, he has never been disciplined at place of employment Responds well to competent superiors who emphasize the safety of their employees Fairness is important to this person, especially when it comes to allocating hours and treating everyone equally with no shows of favoritism    : Other than when the  flipped his own car and was left relatively unscathed, he has had very little direct exposure to automobile accidents During his EMT training, he was exposed to videos and graphic pictures of accidents, but the  is quick to admit that it is not the same thing as observing live trauma We see the candidate as remaining relatively calm and relaxed under pressure as he gave us no reason to doubt that could not remain composed Nonetheless, it will be in the best interests of both parties to give this individual extra training and attention when dealing with emergencies    : Raised to be honest and follow rules, this individual has been faithful to those values Has been gainfully employed since high school; to date, he has no debt in the form of student loans, car payments, or outstanding credit card balances As a youth he was never in trouble with the law; according to the candidate, he has never used any kind of illegal substance Expected to hold himself accountable for his actions; for example, when he broke at piece of equipment at one of his places of work, the  offered to pay for the damages    : Becoming a firefighter/paramedic is a lifelong dream for this individual, and as a result, it is unlikely he will do anything to jeopardize his career in the fire service and EMS As noted above, the candidate is exceptionally close with his father, who is able to provide him with guidance and support when needed Does not appear to possess any harmful habits that might affect his career Reports to consume two alcoholic drinks during an evening An avid outdoorsman; enjoys bow hunting and fishing with family and friends In sum, all of his outlets for pressure and stress are healthy and productive Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Concentrated training and coaching on how to handle himself at the scene of emergencies and trauma Careful monitoring of his written reports and any job-related paperwork as he is prone to providing a minimal amount of information and detail        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Mazur provided relatively accurate information, but the level of detail in all of his written materials was lacking. This could prove to be a cause for concern as the candidate will be required to complete logs and reporting documents in order for the department to be reimbursed for administering a variety of medical procedures. Mr. Mazur e2 80 99s scores on the  reflect his good command of language, yet we suspect that his lack of attention to detail with respect to his written materials is probably a reflection of selective motivation. In other words, if something interests him, he invests the time and energy to master it well. While not an overly sensitive individual, we see this person as able to handle patient concerns and keep them calm in emergency situations. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Mazur to possess the proper thinking skills in order to perform the essential elements and basic functions of the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Mazur to be an acceptable  for the position in question. Both police officers and firefighters stood out to this candidate as role models who enjoyed interesting and exciting occupations. While attending McHenry County Community College, Mr. Mazur began studying fire science in 2016. He has yet to earn his associate e2 80 99s degree, yet he did successfully complete the requirements for his EMT-B in 2017. We see this individual as determined to succeed in the fire service. According to the candidate, he battled to overcome shyness throughout his life, which had an adverse impact on his ability to communicate thoughts in a clear and articulate fashion. While initially, he was anxious, we found that Mr. Mazur gave a good interview during that portion of the assessment process. Despite his relative youth at 21 years old, he has established a fairly solid track record for employment stability. Over the years, Mr. Mazur has developed a very close relationship with his father, who has mentored and guided him throughout this process. We think that with the right coaching from his superiors in the fire service he will develop into a fine firefighter/paramedic. Therefore, in light of our positive review, we would recommend that Mr. Mazur be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Algonquin-Lake in the Hills Fire Protection District \"',\n",

A bit of patience and support on the part of her supervisors will go a long way in facilitating her acceptance and inclusion as a capable and competent firefighter. With her youthful appearance and smaller physical size this  may be easy to underestimate. Our assessment indicates that she will demonstrate her passion and commitment to the job through her determination and stamina.        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Ms. Medendorp provided a thorough and neatly typed account of her personal and professional background that contained essential details and some elaboration when it was necessary. With the other two writing samples administered, Ms. Medendorp demonstrated the ability to express herself in complete and well-formed sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. This bright and conscientious individual will not have difficulty producing professional and informative reports and documentation. Overall, we evaluate Ms. Medendorp to possess above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by her academic and occupational accomplishments to date, and by her outstanding scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. A three-sport athlete during her high school years, Ms. Medendorp graduated from Lincoln-Way West High School with a strong 4.60 (5.00 scale) GPA, taking predominantly honors and advanced placement courses. Intent upon becoming a physician, Ms. Medendorp set off for the University of Illinois at Chicago to major in biology. Although she fared well academically, she began having doubts about eight more years of school and was not especially enjoying her coursework. After taking an EMT-B course and earning her certification, Ms. Medendorp was ready to drop out and focus her efforts on an EMS career instead. However, her parents encouraged her to stay in school and complete her degree, which she did in 2017. Moreover, this hardworking and bright individual did so in only three years. All things considered, Ms. Medendorp has the ability to master the essential information and skills required to become a firefighter and medic.  Ms. Medendorp is the oldest of three children who spent her developmental years in New Lenox where she excelled at the local public schools she attended. This candidate e2 80 99s high needs for achievement became manifest during her high school years with her outstanding academic performance and her grit and determination as a distance runner and soccer player. As noted in  of this report, Ms. Medendorp e2 80 99s vocational goals took a dramatic turn during her early college years once she discovered the direct, hands-on opportunities to serve and assist others as a medic (rather than as a physician). Since that time, this enthusiastic and ambitious individual has prepared herself very well over the past two years in order to position herself as a viable candidate for a career firefighter job. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Medendorp to be an acceptable  for the position in question as she received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. A likable, down-to-earth, and persevering , Ms. Medendorp looks forward to the mental and physical challenges of being a full-time firefighter and first responder. This candidate is very bright and should prove to an adept problem solver with her above average critical thinking skills. Secondly, we found her to be a gregarious and modest candidate who will be able to establish herself as a reliable and dependable firefighter to her peers and superiors over time. In light of our positive review of her qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Ms. Medendorp be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Carol Stream Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

will encounter difficulty integrating into the department    : Maintained that she would like a job involving mental and physical challenges coupled with a e2 80 9cslight bit of travel e2 80 9d Did not appear to be very committed to a career in public safety work Rates about average on our measures of altruism, but has not been involved in any type of volunteer or charitable work in her life An insecure individual who we suspect is drawn to police work for the potential to bolster her sense of inferiority and to increase her sense of self-esteem Will be polite and courteous in her interactions with citizens (if they can hear her)  relevant work and life experience  : Claimed she wanted to pursue a career in law enforcement after graduating high school Went on to obtain a bachelor e2 80 99s degree in fine art from SIU-E in 2017; specialized in painting and drawing While in college, she worked as a desk monitor (presumably at a dormitory) for three years, which allowed her to work on homework while checking ID e2 80 99s Enlisted in the U.S. Army in nuary of 2018, but was medically discharged two months into boot camp Listed her military occupational specialty as a e2 80 9cfixer e2 80 9d and documented her rank as that of a Specialist (E-4) which we found difficult to believe or understand Reportedly accompanied campus officers on a ride-along on one occasion   : Goal-oriented and reasonably conscientious Serious about her duties and responsibilities Likely to require very clear and definitive expectations; seems to misconstrue or confuse directives quite often Stated that previous bosses would describe her as e2 80 9centhusiastic e2 80 9d; yet she came across as low energy, bewildered, and rather bland during her time at our offices Will do what is expected of her; dependent individual who will require a good deal of oversight    : Generally positive relationships with most of the authority figures in her life beginning with her mother and grandparents Seems to enjoy clear expectations, structure, and a disciplined work organization Supervisors may find her difficult to engage for a variety of reasons as she tends to be somewhat isolative and demure coupled with our aforementioned concerns about being on the same page as everyone else in the room Although she described herself as staunchly e2 80 9cstubborn e2 80 9d we believe she will at least make an attempt to incorporate corrective feedback and criticism Current employer reportedly told her she can keep her job with them even if her police testing should not work out for her  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Petite size coupled with insecure and socially awkward presentation Expresses herself in a soft, girlish voice without emotional emphasis or impact Can be direct and straightforward, yet we doubt she will be taken very seriously in response to conflict resolution or confrontational encounters (even though she believes she will be very effective) Offered some ill-informed and ill-advised responses to some routine enforcement scenarios in which she failed to incorporate context; situational awareness was negligible Disappointingly, we do not expect this dimension to improve very much with training and education    : Admittedly has not had to deal with any major stresses or disappointments in her life Rather guarded and tangential in discussing some of the regrets she has had or weaknesses she has discovered about herself Overall, we believe this  has a very different perception of herself in contrast to how others may view her On her behalf, she has followed the rules; no brushes with law enforcement nor has she used illicit drugs (other than a marijuana cookie she spit out because it did not taste very good) Resides with mother after recently graduating from college and washing out of the Army for medical reasons Consistently employed throughout college to the present in some capacity    : Concerns about this  e2 80 99s stability and overall adjustment Although reasonably bright and goal-oriented we had trouble understanding the way she makes meaning out of the events in her life Despite her manufactured self-assuredness, this individual e2 80 99s test results indicate that she is more prone toward prolonged periods of worry and depression than she would care to admit Believes her family and friends are supportive of her in this endeavor, but was not very convincing More self-conscious than she would lead others to believe; likely to personalize the negativity and resistance she will encounter on the streets; questionable sense of self-esteem  We will defer in making any definitive recommendations regarding this  due to her overall unpreparedness for police work. More specifically, we do not believe any amount of training, education, or mentoring will be impactful as most of her concerns involve longstanding personality characteristics, which are not likely to change very much over time.   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  BELOW AVERAGE BELOW AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Ms. Meeky provided a typed account of her personal and professional background that contained minimal and basic information without much elaboration. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this  demonstrated below average writing ability. Although she was able to formulate her ideas in complete sentences most of the time, there were notable deficiencies in her punctuation and grammar at times. Most importantly, we were concerned with the brevity and lack of thoroughness in handling documentation and report writing. This individual seems to perceive events and situations in a rather different way than others which may will further compromise her accuracy and clarity with police reports. Overall, we evaluate Ms. Meeky to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported by her educational accomplishments to date, and by most of her scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above. Ms. Meeky graduated from Homewood-Flossmoor High School in 2013 with a reported 3.30 GPA. During her high school years she was involved with sports for most of those years. In 2017, Ms. Meeky obtained her bachelor e2 80 99s degree in art from Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville graduating with a reported 2.70 GPA. While she possesses the mental ability to master most of the essential information required to become a police officer, we have significant concerns about her critical thinking skills, and we have doubts about her ability to apply what she has learned in the actual performance of her duties due to some of her personality characteristics (documented in Parts II and IV of this report).  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Meeky to be an unacceptable  for the position in question, as she received unfavorable ratings on most of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. To begin with, Ms. Meeky has a very unusual view of police work and her desire to work in law enforcement is rooted in her fascination with movies and video games she played and still watches such as e2 80 9cCharmed e2 80 9d and e2 80 9cDragon Ball Z e2 80 9d through which she found herself enjoying e2 80 9cfighting off demons. e2 80 9d Furthermore, this candidate e2 80 99s responses to some routine enforcement scenarios were rather bizarre and e2 80 9coff the wall e2 80 9d in terms of her intervention strategies, perhaps because she views herself as a creative artist. Nevertheless, her practical judgment and information processing will raise serious officer and citizen safety concerns. At the same time, Ms. Meeky staunchly believes she has everything it takes to be a competent and capable police officer, which also reflects an exaggerated sense of her own competence, effectiveness, and prowess. In this regard, Ms. Meeky maintained that the most frightened she has been in her life was last week when her mother was screaming about a large spider in their laundry room. Although she was tentative and very apprehensive to approach it, she gathered the courage to dispatch the spider with a long e2 80 9cswifter. e2 80 9d If this individual is indeed serious about a law enforcement career, we would strongly advise her to obtain some relevant or related experience, perhaps in an auxiliary law enforcement role or by working retail security. In light of our many concerns and reservations, we would recommend that the Commission take a pass on Ms. Meeky and continue to search for more mature and better prepared s to serve as a Police Officer in the City of Country Club Hills, Illinois. \"',\n",

Personality does change over periods of time as a result of life experiences, successes and failures over the course of life, and major life events and traumas. In the case of public safety candidates, the exposure to tragic, traumatic, and emotionally charged events in the line of duty, coupled with the need for a quick adaptation to a paramilitary culture predicts for an increased likelihood of adjustment difficulties and possible personality changes quicker than other professions.

May need some reminders to slow things a bit in order to become more deliberate and circumspect before taking action during emergencies. Even though she is an English major who specialized in grammar, Ms. Memmesheimer may need some reminders to be more detailed and thorough in her report writing and documentation.        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Ms. Memmesheimer submitted a neatly typed account of her personal and professional background that was not entirely complete or informative. Although she has the capacity to express herself in complete and coherent sentences that contain proper grammar and syntax, this former English major was not always attentive to details, and she generally expressed herself in clauses and phrases in which a more elaborative and professional response would have been more appropriate. It was our sense that Ms. Memmesheimer may have rushed through this aspect of her assessment. While we believe Ms. Memmesheimer will be able to produce informative and professional reports as a firefighter and medic, we would advise that her supervisors give her some guidance about the importance of thorough and conscientious documentation in this line of work. Overall, we evaluate Ms. Memmesheimer to possess above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by her academic accomplishments to date, and by her outstanding scores on our standardized tests of mental ability cited above. Ms. Memmesheimer graduated from Marist High School in 2010 with a strong 4.80 (5.00 scale) grade point average. During her high school years, she participated in sports the first two years then began working part-time. With the intention of working in the publishing field, Ms. Memmesheimer went on to earn her bachelor e2 80 99s degree in English from Illinois State University in 2014, graduating with a reported 3.70 GPA. During her internships in the publishing arena, Ms. Memmesheimer realized that she was not a very good fit for that line of work and began working toward bettering her skills and qualifications for a fire service career immediately thereafter. This  obtained her associate e2 80 99s degree in fire science from MVCC in 2017, once again graduating with a respectable 3.60 GPA. All things considered, Ms. Memmesheimer has the ability to obtain advanced fire service certifications, and we believe she is likely to catch on quickly in her ability to master essential job functions.  The youngest of three children, Ms. Memmesheimer spent most of her developmental years in south suburban Crestwood where she attended local parochial schools. After completing her degree in English and publishing in 2014, Ms. Memmesheimer made a rather dramatic change in career direction, as she decided to pursue a career in which she would make a more positive and direct impact on the lives of others. We did not find this particularly surprising in light of her altruistic and volunteer efforts throughout her college years assisting underserved and needy populations. This  simply feels good about herself when she is able to assist others in a meaningful way. After talking to some family friends in the fire service, Ms. Memmesheimer stated that she found out how to become a firefighter and medic by e2 80 9cgoogling e2 80 9d it on the internet. A determined and energetic individual, this  has applied herself diligently toward her goal of connecting with a career fire department. A determined and energetic individual, Ms. Memmesheimer has now had some valuable experience with two south suburban departments in a part-time capacity, and has grown and developed considerably in terms of her competence and increased self-confidence. A hard worker and a likable young woman, this candidate grew up with two brothers, and she should not have difficulty acclimating to a male-dominated career organization. In fact, she will enjoy the challenge of proving herself to her male counterparts, and will get along with just about everyone in an amicable and considerate manner. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Memmesheimer to be an acceptable  for the position in question, as she received either e2 80 9cacceptable e2 80 9d or e2 80 9cstrong e2 80 9d ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. Overall, we like the balance she presents for the position in terms of her enthusiasm, energy level, and intelligence. She should prove to be a pleasure to supervise. In light of our review, we would recommend that Ms. Memmesheimer be extended an offer of employment to serve as a Firefighter for the Alsip Fire Department. \"',\n",

To the contrary, the candidate looks young in terms of his personal appearance, and furthermore, his more reserved manner contributes to the impression that the public might not find him particularly approachable. Yet, after assessing Mr. Much, he presents himself as an  who possesses a number of fine attributes that will translate nicely into working as a police officer. This person is able to get along well with others. In particular, Mr. Much minds his own business, and he is not inclined to get into arguments or disputes with other people, including his fellow officers at the agency as well as the citizens of the community. Additionally, the  is a hardworking individual who sets high goals and aspirations for himself and then achieves those objectives. We think that he will take his duties and responsibilities seriously. Most importantly, Mr. Much is gifted with a strong , dating back to his youth with the Boy Scouts of America. While we see him administering the law in a fair fashion, Mr. Much might be prone to showing leniency for routine offenses, such as minor traffic violations. With coaching and guidance from his superiors, we think that he will overcome any misgivings about writing violations. Regardless, in light of our overall favorable review of this individual, we would recommend that Mr. Much be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Hanover Park. \"',\n",

Name: Adam Nelli Position: Police Officer Age: 21 Department: Police Department Date: July 29, 2019     : Clean-shaven with a particularly neat haircut Professionally attired, wearing a dark-colored business suit and tie Through no fault of his own, he looks young as he is only 21 years of age Friendly manner predicts positively for being perceived as an approachable police presence  y  : Friendly and even-tempered; possesses a good-natured disposition Though more experienced than many s his age (due in part to his longstanding affiliation with Channahon PD), the candidate will give the proper respect to more senior officers and defer to their experience and expertise Along this same line, he is a pleasant and polite person Comes across as energetic and enthusiastic Positive attitude will contribute to good morale around the station Accommodating and even-tempered but will not compromise morals or ethics in order to simply fit in at the department    : Marked in part by his commitment to the National Guard, this young candidate e2 80 99s direction and chosen path has always pointed toward serving the public and helping others Stated that if police work was not an option, he would seek employment in emergency management Finds helping people to be rewarding and wants to incorporate that feeling into his day-to-day work This person also enjoys the opportunity to solve problems, which he believes is a large part of a career in law enforcement  relevant work and life experience  : Joined the Channahon Police Cadet Program when he was a freshman in high school Enlisted in the U.S. Army National Guard in February of 2016 for a six-year commitment; functions as an MP (Military Police Officer) with rank of E-4 Participated as part of the Puerto Rico disaster relief effort with the Army national Guard Hired as part-time campus security for Joliet Junior College in September of 2017; still currently employed there Currently in progress of obtaining his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in law enforcement and administration from Western Illinois University through an online program   : Hardworking and committed to his chosen field; will be seen as a motivated professional Had a major setback when his antique weapon discharged, leaving his hand severely injured, and it caused the candidate to miss a military deployment Regardless, the incident did not deter him from his commitment to his unit Generally focused and attentive to the task at hand; wants to work hard to succeed and be recognized for his efforts when he has done a job well On the other hand, his focus can cause this candidate to lose track of time and make a simple task more complex than required    : Raised with a healthy respect for those in positions of authority Reports never having been terminated from any previous place of work Similarly, he has not received any disciplinary actions against him in civilian life While serving in the military, the candidate was the recipient of two counseling notices: one for failing a physical fitness test and the other for doing his laundry after lights-out Nonetheless, his experience in a police cadet program along with his time in the Army National Guard, as well as working for campus public safety have given him a solid understanding and appreciation of the structure of military and paramilitary environments Respects the chain-of-command Will respond well to an approachable and supportive supervisor  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : This person can be expected to act in a polite and helpful fashion to routine citizen complaints and concerns For example, while working as a Campus Safety Officer at Joliet Junior College, the candidate is charged with assisting motorists with lockouts, changing tires, and other types of inconveniences Although he looks young, this individual has experience administering rules and regulations in his capacity as a Campus Safety Officer at Joliet Junior College In particular, the  writes parking citations On other occasions, he has had to respond to fights and domestic disputes    : At the age of 21, this candidate presents himself in as professionally mature Reports no arrests and never having used any kind of illegal substances Moreover, he holds himself accountable for his actions Specifically, he assumed full responsibility for the accident when one of the antique handguns in his collection accidentally discharged and injured him On the other hand, his preoccupation with playing videogames for up to five hours a day several times a week strikes us as excessive for a person who is otherwise rather responsible    : Exposure to military and paramilitary settings has prepared this person properly for what to expect with regard to the position in question He understands, for example, that the job has its peaks and valleys of activities Additionally, he is prepared for the rotating shifts that can adversely impact relationships along with scheduled activities with family and friends Maintains a good network of people to help him deal with stress and frustration Interest in collecting antique weapons has allowed the  to bond with his father Appears to have no harmful habits that would impair his job performance Does admit to consuming up to six wine coolers a couple of times a month when he is not operating a vehicle  Coaching on how to handle the more complex types of citizen interactions, such as domestic disputes Reminders about the potential pitfalls in alcohol consumption, as issues have the potential to spill over        s)     With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Nelli provided a clear and comprehensive overview of his personal and professional background on our Personal History Form. The candidate paid attention to each inquiry and responded with relevant answers and an appropriate level of detail. We also rely on other two exercises to evaluate written communication skills, including a mock police report and a description of both a highlight and setback of an individual e2 80 99s life experiences. Mr. Nelli e2 80 99s written communication showed very good attention to writing mechanics, as he used proper sentence structure with good grammar, and descriptive wording that was clear and understandable. His level of detail was, once again, quite sufficient. Moreover, the scores this candidate registered on the cognitive ability test we administer at our offices are reflective of Mr. Nelli e2 80 99s excellent high school and collegiate grades. Although we believe he has slightly above average mental ability, this candidate e2 80 99s hard work and determination will make it that much easier for him to master the essential duties of the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Nelli to be an acceptable  for the position in question. Despite being only 21-years old, and looking every bit his youthful age, this person presents himself as a credible candidate. Mr. Nelli has gained valuable experience through his exposure to the Channahon Police Department e2 80 99s Cadet Program while he was only a freshman in high school. Later he would join the U.S. Army National Guard as a Military Police Officer. At present, Mr. Nelli works as a Campus Safety Officer at Joliet Junior College and handles routine public safety matters, ranging from disturbances on campus to administering parking regulations and assisting motorists in need of help. This kind of  speaks directly to the candidate e2 80 99s commitment to a career in the field of law enforcement. It also bodes well for his remaining in this line of work for the long term. While we see some of his behaviors as more juvenile, like his playing videogames for long stretches of time and also his alcohol consumption on occasion, there is little else that gives us cause for concern about this candidate. The incident mentioned in  of this report regarding the accidental discharging of his weapon seems to be a true mistake, for which the candidate has accepted responsibility and dealt with the consequences, hence we do not think that kind of incident is likely to occur ever again. Although his level of professional maturity is way ahead of track, his social maturity level could probably stand a bit of growth. Nevertheless, we believe this hardworking and determined candidate will represent a good hire and positive addition to the department. In light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Nelli be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Channahon. \"',\n",

Name: Matthew Pagakis Position: Police Officer Age: 33 Department: Police Department Date: May 16, 2019     : Professionally attired and well-groomed for his appointment at our office Lacks some clarity in the way that he communicates; expresses himself in a rather roundabout manner This person is relatively easy to engage in conversation Business-like demeanor; at the same time, he was polite and pleasant Will likely be perceived as an approachable and credible police officer  y  : An outgoing person who enjoys interacting with people; he desires to work on a team Presented overall as a capable person, yet he appeared unaccustomed to a formal interview process; this could explain why he was a bit evasive in his responses at times Did not strike us as a very introspective person, but he certainly came across as even keeled and polite Sympathetic to others e2 80 99 hardships; a quality of his that will be appreciated on a team    : Sincere and genuine in wanting to serve and protect the community Interested in interacting with the community and assisting with challenges that arise; he enjoys the variety of this type of work Finds work related to public safety highly rewarding; it gives him a sense of purpose  relevant work and life experience  : Since leaving college he has held a full-time position at Walmart Supply Chain since November of 2009 on their tractor trailer maintenance crew; enjoys working with his hands and has been known as e2 80 9cthe fix-it guy e2 80 9d Recruited to be a part-time police officer by Grand Ridge Police Department in September of 2017 Also works part-time at Marseilles Police Department where he has been since October of 2018; this department also wanted to hire him Earned his part-time police certification in October of 2018 Attended Illinois Valley Community College between 2004 and 2006 taking courses as a criminal justice major; he did not list completing any degree   : Hardworking and industrious person with no history of terminations throughout his employment history Currently working three jobs simultaneously Reportedly rarely shows up late to work or takes sick days unless it is for reasons related to his children; reliable and dependable employee Likes to stay busy and productive Has been recognized among his peers at Walmart by being awarded the 2017 associate of the year award Strikes us as a disciplined individual who will be conscientious in his basic work habits; although it is possible that he may not go above and beyond    : Relationships with those who have power and authority over him have been fairly positive throughout his life Expected to adhere to departmental policies and procedures; seems compliant in his interactions with superiors Acknowledges mistakes and shortcomings, though he can become a bit defensive at times; he will want to explain himself and then be open to feedback Appears to work best under an honest and easygoing supervisor; he spoke highly about his past and present supervisors Received one disciplinary write-up for transporting a citizen beyond the geographical boundaries of the Marseilles department without following the proper protocol  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Assertive and confident person who will treat citizens with common courtesy and respect Stable individual with some life experience under his belt; we expect him to maintain his poise and composure under stress May need to develop a more clear and straightforward way of expressing himself in dealing with urgent and pressurized situations Aware of officer safety concerns; will deliberate before taking action in order to account for the safety of others and himself He will be firm in the enforcement of laws and ordinances, at the same time, he will utilize his discretionary powers as a police officer wisely    : According to this candidate, he has never been arrested, received a traffic ticket, or experimented with illegal drugs Consumes about 12 beers once a month at most, according to him He has followed the rules throughout his life; expected to hold himself accountable for his actions in his personal and professional life Has reasonable unpaid financial obligations    : This 33-year-old individual struck us as a stable, grounded, relatively well-adjusted adult This person has experienced challenges and difficulties throughout his life, and he has adapted appropriately for the most part Although fairly engaging, tends to keep his thoughts and feelings to himself especially if he is stressed; he might need support with introspection after a stressful event When work becomes stressful, he thinks about how to handle the situation at hand Enjoys strong support from his close friends, family, and especially his wife who he has been with for 13 years To relax outside of work, he watches television and spends time with his family  Admitted that he has a tendency to become distracted, particularly when it comes to events that he perceives as monotonous. May need some reminders to initiate his own activity at times. Although he recently became certified as a part-time police officer, remember that this individual is still relatively green with police work. A bit of patience and encouragement on the part of his supervisors will probably go a long way with this candidate.        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, he completed all of the required paperwork regarding his personal and professional history. While he provided all necessary information, Mr. Pagakis lacked elaboration at points throughout his Personal History Form when some more details would have been helpful beyond using such short words and phrases. On that note, Mr. Pagakis will need guidance in being more descriptive and elaborative in his report writing when necessary. We also administered two other writing samples, and in all exercises, this  demonstrated sufficient writing ability, and we expect his reports to be professional and adequate, especially after the proper training. As shown above, Mr. Pagakis scored high on the verbal ability portion and below average on the quantitative ability portion of our standardized test. His verbal score is encouraging in that he can rely on his solid verbal skills when completing the paperwork necessary for the position in question. Mr. Pagakis lists receiving average grades during high school, and that he attended Illinois Valley Community College for a couple of years just over a decade ago. This candidate appears to have good common sense and an overall sense of social awareness that will serve him well in public safety work. What he may lack in innate intelligence, he will likely make up for with his determination and respect for the law enforcement field. We believe Mr. Pagakis will take his job duties seriously, and all things considered, this individual has the ability to learn the essential job functions required of a police officer.  Mr. Pagakis currently lives in Ottawa, Illinois, with his wife and two children. He was also born and raised by his biological parents in Ottawa, where they taught him the value of hard work. He wanted to become a police officer for as long as he can remember. From all indications he has a close and supportive family. He attended local public schools, and though his grades were average, he decided to begin working right after graduating high school. Although he seemed to have started pursuing his dream of becoming a police officer upon his high school graduation, he and his wife had their first son when he was in his early twenties. Starting a family early caused him to put off his career aspirations in order to support his growing family. Mr. Pagakis described the toughest problem he has faced in his life as being the death of his second child, which happened six months after his daughter was conceived. Mr. Pagakis and his wife then had a third child and they very much enjoy spending family time together. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Pagakis to be an acceptable  for the position in question. This individual is motivated by a sincere desire to protect the community, particularly keeping the children safe. It should be noted that although he wants to be a police officer, his first choice of a department is Ottawa Police Department and he will accept a position there if it is offered to him so that he can protect the community in which he lives. We find him to be equally motivated to perform the community service and enforcement aspects of the job but is expected to take an interest in mentoring kids and young adults. This thoughtful and well-meaning individual will need some polishing during his training to ensure he effectively communicates with the public. With the proper training we believe he is capable of developing into a competent and effective full-time, sworn police officer. In light of our review, we would recommend that Mr. Pagakis be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Seneca. ERL/\"',\n",

Name: Ryan Perez Position: Police Officer Age: 26 Department: Police Department Date: May 28, 2019     : Clean-cut and well-groomed personal appearance Well-built physique, exercises at least five days per week Appropriately attired in a dress shirt and tie Projects a credible police presence Open and honest in admitting a number of troublesome incidents in his experiences as a police officer  y  : Enjoys the camaraderie of a police department, sees it as a second family for him Lacking a close family upbringing, we can see how this person gravitates to the closeness of his peers in the department Comes across as confident in his abilities, to the point that certain people might perceive him as too self-assured Will likely drop his tough-guy fa c3 a7ade in the presence of his fellow officers, but renew it quickly once he returns to the street Nonetheless, the  rates rather low on our measures of agreeableness    : Raised with a blue-collar background, the candidate sees law enforcement as a respectable line of work Wants to make a difference and have a positive impact on people While we believe that this person is sincere in his , it is clear that he is most strongly attracted to this line of work for its variety and excitement In his own words, he wants to take e2 80 9cbad guys off the streets e2 80 9d  relevant work and life experience  : Minored in criminal justice while attending Elgin Community College; received his associate e2 80 99s degree from ECC in 2013 For the last three and one-half years, this person has been working as a police officer for the Village of Dolton Initially hired by the Dolton Police Department on a part-time basis in 2015, he completed the academy for part-time officers sponsored by NEMRT When moved to a full-time officer e2 80 99s position, he was sent to the SWIC police training academy which he finished in 2016   : Describes himself as e2 80 9ca really active officer; e2 80 9d does not sit around, and wants to be proactive and show initiative Seeks a larger, better staffed department with more resources Claims he has had only one disciplinary action taken against him by the Dolton Police Department, for scraping the under panel of his police cruiser Candidate faced litigation from members of the public as consequences of his behavior on the job, but he sees nothing wrong with how he handled those incidents Has a track record for high-speed pursuits; seems he might be reckless behind the wheel    : Although the  has been working in a paramilitary setting for over three years, we believe he prefers to do things his own way In his zeal to make arrests, this person might be inclined to bend the rules to suit his needs In light of this candidate facing litigious charges, we were not surprised when he stated his desire to have superiors who will have his back and support his actions Candidate could not identify any areas where he might improve his performance or behavior; this predicts for someone who will be defensive in the face of constructive criticism  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : In his desire to take e2 80 9cbad guys off the streets, e2 80 9d the  will be seen as an overly aggressive officer To date, he has been sued by members of the public on several occasions Most of these lawsuits have related to injuries to innocent victims that were caused by the candidate e2 80 99s actions when pursuing suspects at extremely dangerous speeds Although he was cleared of wrongdoing, this candidate has used lethal force in his enforcement tactics and has taken a person e2 80 99s life Did not appear to show any remorse in describing the two fatalities that occurred in which his actions were directly involved    : Struggles to hold himself accountable for his actions For example, in discussing one of the several lawsuits against him for causing a traffic accident that resulted in a person e2 80 99s serious injury, the candidate claims that he does not see e2 80 9chow [he] did anything wrong e2 80 9d This kind of reaction predicts for excuse-making along with an unwillingness to learn from his past mistakes We also believe this person exercises questionable judgment when it comes to drinking alcohol; admits to consuming up to six beers when going out with his friends    : One of the reasons why this individual has been able to show resilience is that he is a thrill-seeker Where most people might be bothered by a high level of stress in their work, the  actively seeks those kinds of situations which will produce an adrenaline rush Enjoys having the job of a sworn police officer; only seeks to change agencies for reasons having to do with better resources Relies on such forms of stress relief as engaging in regular exercise and spending time with his girlfriend whom he met about a year and one-half ago at a health club  Our report paints a picture of a problematic hire. And not one where training, coaching, or mentoring is likely to remedy the issues cited by our findings.        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Perez was accurate and complete. We also administered two other writing samples (both of which were typed). On each of these exercises, this  demonstrated acceptable writing ability. In his behalf, the candidate was generally attentive to most of the important details. While Mr. Perez wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, he did not always use proper grammar or syntax. We believe that his problems with grammar and syntax are most likely due to Mr. Perez rushing through these items, especially when filling out the mock police report. Nevertheless, this individual is experienced with police paperwork and report writing. The fact that he scored well on both sections of the  indicates that he has the mental capacity to learn and retain information, yet his zealousness and need for action can stand in the way of his decision making. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Perez as possessing the mental ability necessary to perform the essential tasks of the position in question, yet he is lacking in other qualities that will hinder his performance. This candidate has an observed deficit in empathy and compassion for other people, as Mr. Perez e2 80 99s reaction to the death and injury he has been involved with during his brief career was frighteningly lacking.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Perez to be an unacceptable  for the position in question even though he is currently serving in the capacity of a sworn police officer with the Village of Dolton. The problems that this person has encountered during his very brief tenure with the Dolton PD give us serious cause for concern. To date, he has been sued by multiple citizens for the outcomes of his high-speed automobile pursuits. These situations resulted in serious injuries to the occupants of cars hit at high speeds by suspects evading pursuit initiated by Mr. Perez. Another lawsuit resulted from his going hands-on with a combative individual, who when administered tranquillizer drugs, suddenly died. In another incident, even though the candidate was cleared in a hearing, he used his service revolver to shoot and kill a person during a robbery that threatened the life of one of his fellow police officers. We see Mr. Perez as an overly aggressive officer, who while highly proactive and willing to show initiative, can stretch the boundaries of authority. This kind of reckless behavior, to include operating his police cruiser in high speed pursuits, places any department at risk of serious litigation. In closing, although Mr. Perez has experience in the field and strives to be active and productive officer, thus far his career has been marked with troubling incidents for which he feels no remorse and takes no accountability. We do not want to pass along another police department e2 80 99s problematic employee, therefore, in light of our many stated concerns and reservations, we would not be comfortable in recommending that Mr. Perez be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Woodridge. \"',\n",

Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we do not believe the candidate has demonstrated sufficient emotional intelligence. Most of his world view is filtered through the lens of his own needs and perspective. In short, Mr. Rahimi fails to see things from other points of view.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Rahimi to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. Mr. Rahimi received an unusually high number of marginal ratings in  of this report. While relatively young at age 25, Mr. Rahimi has failed to settle on a suitable career choice. At one time he thought about teaching school but claims that he could not land a suitable job. After college the candidate did es, and at present he is a laborer for a landscaping firm. Even though Mr. Rahimi enjoys working with his hands, we suspect that he accepted the job of a laborer as a way to support his young family. Now, the candidate claims that he wants to become a sworn police officer. At several of his past jobs, to include his role as an R.A. while at college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he has felt victimized by others, and his superiors in particular. It is never his fault for being disciplined or relieved of his duties, and instead Mr. Rahimi points the finger of blame at other people. This kind of reaction reflects immaturity. There is also evidence that this individual is excitable and prone to making quick decisions. In a position like that of a police officer, this could quickly lead to the candidate becoming an officer safety hazard to himself and others. In sum, there is little reason to suggest that Mr. Rahimi is ready at this point in his life to assume such a responsible role. Therefore, in light of our highly cautious review, we would not recommend that Mr. Rahimi be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Schaumburg. \"',\n",

Name: Ryan Rasmas Position: Police Officer Age: 24 Department: Police Department Date: February 8, 2018     : Tall, athletically-built; a former high school and college standout athlete in baseball Clean-cut and well-groomed personal appearance Appropriately attired in a suit and tie for his appointment at our office Projects a pleasant and friendly demeanor and will be seen as approachable as well as authoritative  y  : Friendly and likeable outward disposition despite being private and reserved by nature Will be seen as courteous and respectful to his fellow officers at the agency Generally accepting of other people, will be seen as tolerant Can be anxious and occasionally somewhat talkative, but once he acclimates to his surroundings he will relax and feel more confident in his abilities Communicates clearly and leaves little room for misunderstanding Heavily invested in his own health and physical fitness, which could come across to his colleagues as sounding self-absorbed    : Looks forward to serving as a role-model for young people; had similar status as an athlete when younger people looked up to him for guidance and advice Sees being the face of the community as rewarding Also attracted to law enforcement for the opportunity to be active and avoid sitting behind a desk all day long Besides appreciating the variety and excitement associated with the job, he is looking to grow and develop professionally  relevant work and life experience  : Earned his A.A. degree in criminal justice from Prairie State College in 2016 Did not perform any kind of an internship in connection with his degree program at Prairie State College Currently serving in the capacity of a part-time, auxiliary police officer with the Crestwood Police Department; has been with the agency since October of 2016 Primary duties involve patrolling the local shopping centers and writing citations for parking violations   : At age 24 he has yet to establish any kind of a track record for employment stability Most of his previous jobs have lasted about a year, with the exception of his present part-time position mentioned above Takes care to come to work e2 80 9cclean-shaven e2 80 9d and ready to work Has not encountered any trouble at his previous places of work, to include being terminated or disciplined by his superiors However, with above average needs for variety and excitement, he might show signs of selective motivation    : Has a healthy respect for those in positions of authority Got along well with teachers and coaches during his youth Reports no incidents with the law as either a youngster or as an adult, aside from two traffic violations Responds well to a supervisor who lets him know where he stands with them Wants to be told directly if he is making mistakes, and more importantly, provided guidance on how to correct his behavior In sum, he demands directness; does poorly with ambiguity or a lack of certainty  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Physical presence will project a calming influence Knows how to use his words On the other hand, the  admits that he has been rather lenient with people, especially parking violators We suspect that he might not like the paperwork and reporting piece of his position, so that excusing violators eliminates the need to write them up for their offenses    : Has avoided situations which would harm his chances of gaining a position in law enforcement Even before considering law enforcement as a career, he stayed away from such temptations as illegal drugs, due in large part to his wanting to stay in peak physical condition in order to continue his baseball career Generally holds himself accountable for his actions This rather literal thinker possesses somewhat limited self-awareness of his own shortcomings; this could lead to excuse-making if he disagrees with superiors about certain implications of his behavior on the job    : Will be sensitive to any aspect of his job that might have an adverse impact on his physical conditioning For example, if shiftwork impacts his sleeping patterns, he is likely to complain As long as this individual is able to preserve his rigorous workout regimen, he will be able to maintain an appropriate balance between his mental and physical well-being Appears to have a suitable network of support people, to include friends and family Has no harmful habits that will impair his job performance; for example, he consumes alcohol in moderation so as not to harm his health Overall, he is committed to law enforcement as a viable lifelong career after an eye injury ended his hopes of playing professional baseball  Like many selectively motivated individuals, the candidate might require reminding to attend to the more mundane parts of the job, such as traffic patrol and report writing Monitoring of his paperwork and report writing to make sure they are presented neatly and contain the sufficient amount of information and detail Tracking his ticket writing to ensure that he is not being too lenient as his way of having to perform less paperwork Clear and direct feedback on his performance, leaving no room for ambiguity   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Rasmas e2 80 99 handwriting was difficult to decipher. For example, it contained several strike-outs. We administered two writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On all of his exercises, this  demonstrated minimally acceptable writing ability. In particular, the candidate could have been more attentive to the details. In addition, Mr. Rasmas did not always write in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, or use the proper grammar and syntax. As can be seen by his lower score on the  section of the s, writing skills are not one of Mr. Rasmas e2 80 99 strengths. As with many people who do not excel in certain areas, they are less interested in preforming such tasks. This is clearly the case with the candidate, who as we mentioned in  of this report, shows signs of being selectively motivated. As a result, monitoring his paperwork and report writing will probably be necessary, especially during his probationary period. Overall, however, we evaluate Mr. Rasmas to be bright enough to master the essential elements of the job in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Rasmas to be an acceptable  for the position in question. As implied from our previous  about the candidate, he entertained serious thoughts about becoming a major league baseball player. Toward that end, he attended both community college and a four-year school in Texas in order to play baseball. Unfortunately, an eye injury occurred while attending college in Texas. Even though Mr. Rasmas e2 80 99 condition was operable and has been successfully corrected, playing major league baseball without near perfect vision is for all practical purposes impossible. Meanwhile, Mr. Rasmas has an older brother who is a police officer. When the latter individual was sworn in at the Park Forest Police Department, his younger brother began to give serious consideration to a career in law enforcement. In order to follow-up on his aspirations for becoming a police officer, Mr. Rasmas returned to Prairie State College, the school he attended after graduating high school in order to play community college baseball. This time, however, Mr. Rasmas completed the requirements for his associate e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice. Since the fall of 2016, he has been performing an auxiliary police officer with the Crestwood Police Department. Hence, he has gained valuable educational and job-related experience, making him a viable candidate for the role. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Rasmas be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Chicago Heights. \"',\n",

Name: mi Robins Position: Police Officer Age: 34 Department: Police Department Date: September 3, 2019     : Arrived late for her appointment due to transportation problems, although she did call to inform us of her tardiness Casually groomed and attired for her appointment at our office While the  does not project a credible police presence, she is a friendly and approachable person Overall, we found her easy to engage in conversation  y  : Socially awkward individual, who has a propensity to personalize how she is perceived by her fellow employees On the one hand, she has described certain male employees as having a e2 80 9ccrush e2 80 9d on her In other instances, she describes her coworkers as e2 80 9cmaking up horrible things e2 80 9d about her, especially her female peers Overall, she tends to see the worst in her fellow employees Finally, the  possesses an idealized and unrealistic notion of police work, which will be readily apparent to her fellow officers and a likely source of contention    : To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, she has volunteered her time in behalf of other people Most of her volunteering has been done in connection with a group called Messianic Christians Moreover, the  scores exceptionally high on our measures of altruism According to the candidate, becoming a police officer is e2 80 9cher calling e2 80 9d Motivated to punish people who fail to follow the rules  relevant work and life experience  : No post-high school degrees or training pertaining to law enforcement or criminal justice Spent one summer at Six Flags Great America working at the front gate inspecting bags and backpacks Has volunteered on at least three occasions to perform security for her Messianic Christian organization Finally, she reports chaperoning a youth retreat for young women that involved enforcing various rules and regulations   : Many of this person e2 80 99s jobs have been for a relatively short term, often less than year The  reports being terminated from no less than five different places of employment over the last 15 years The reasons for her termination include everything from not doing as she was told to an accusation of theft In each and every instance this individual offered an excuse to explain the reasons that her termination was unjust    : This individual has never served in any kind of an organization that was either military or paramilitary in nature According to the candidate, she is looking to her superiors to take her input and advice The candidate has offered a number of critical  about her prior managers, to include describing one as e2 80 9cmentally ill e2 80 9d Highly sensitive to criticism, it will be very difficult for this person to hear constructive advice from her superiors aimed at improving her job performance without becoming extremely defensive  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : The lack of maturity and judgment exercised by this individual in the past as well as at present gives us serious pause for concern Without any prior experience in handling serious encounters, we are worried about her reaction when faced with potentially dangerous and even life-threatening confrontations With an exaggerated sense of her capabilities, the candidate could easily create an officer safety hazard Moreover, in a community like Zion where tact and diplomacy along with acute judgment and common sense are required, this individual falls far short of the mark    : In her behalf, this person reports have never having been arrested or having used any kind of illegal drugs or substances Moreover, she rarely consumes alcohol At present this person is divorced; candidate claims that her ex-husband turned into e2 80 9ca different person e2 80 9d after they married As more than implied in our previous , the  cannot hold herself accountable for her actions, and instead, she seeks to blame others for her setbacks and disappointments    : It is very difficult for us to believe that this individual will be able to survive her probationary period with the agency In fact, we would be surprised if she were able to complete her full cycle at the police training academy In her behalf, she has a strong support group of her fellow Messianic Christians Yet even with this group along with her regular exercise routine, she is unlikely to weather the pressure and stress that she will encounter as a new police officer With a penchant for getting terminated from many of her prior jobs, we are not terribly optimistic about her long-term chances to be a successful police officer  The issues we uncovered in our assessment of this  are unlikely to change or be modified in a significant fashion so as to allow this person to perform the position as expected        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s online materials submitted as part of our assessment, Ms. Robins provided a rather detailed account of her background and experience on her Personal Histrory Form. We also administered two other writing samples, which were typewritten prior to the  e2 80 99s appointment at our office. On both of these exercises, this  demonstrated marginally acceptable writing ability in terms of the care and conscientiousness that Ms. Robins put into each exercise. For example, the candidate was far from attentive to the important details, especially in her handling of the mock police report. On the other hand, Ms. Robins generally wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, while making use of the proper grammar and syntax. Furthermore, Ms. Robins performed extremely well on the  as reported above. There is no question that from an academic standpoint Ms. Robins is smart; in fact, we believe that she is probably very smart. On the other hand, her judgment and common sense seem to be lacking in the requisite amounts required to perform effectively in the position in question as a police officer on the street.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Ms. Robins to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. Not only did the  accumulate a fair number of marginal ratings in this report, but we also view her as rating poorly on a couple of key dimensions. Despite the candidate e2 80 99s claims that law enforcement is her calling and that she is well-suited for the role, our assessment indicates otherwise. The possibility that this person could become an officer safety hazard is seen as quite high. Even if her judgment and aptitudes were better suited for this line of work, we would have our reservations. For example, throughout this person e2 80 99s life, and in particular, as an adult, she has struggled to get along with other people, both on and off the job. Having been fired from at least five prior jobs and continuing to make excuses and judge others is behavior that predicts for a person who will continue to be challenged in the future to get along well with others. Unable to hold herself accountable for her actions, this person will have trouble growing and developing as a police professional. Her tenure, which we predict will be short wherever she is employed in law enforcement, will be marked by excessive amounts of excuse-making. Therefore, in light of our highly critical review of this candidate, we would not recommend that Ms. Robins be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Zion. \"',\n",

will not be perceived as very warm or approachable Seems to go out of his way to ensure others keep their distance from him Confident and straightforward in his communication style Much more open and candid during his interview than his body language might suggest While he will be viewed as an authoritative officer, not many will want to approach him for assistance  y  : As hinted above, this individual is an angry and introverted person with extremely low needs for inclusion and acceptance from others;

enjoys a few recreational activities but tends to be highly competitive Operates under a great deal of pressure and tension; gives many indications of becoming a problem employee rather quickly  Bright and hardworking individual appears to have sabotaged his efforts to make society a better place because of his inner fears, turmoil, anger, and insecurity. Emotionally troubled individual with a history of anger management problems since he was in high school. Unfortunately, this  has little insight or awareness of the source of his inner demons which seem to emanate from childhood and developmental experiences which continue to haunt him. Despite his scowling and wary demeanor, this individual very much wants to be included and accepted by others. Moreover, he would like to have enjoyable and fulfilling human interaction. He simply does not know how to accomplish that.   Below Average Average Above Average Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Apprai Test (assesses logical reasoning skills & ability to make critical evaluations of arguments & assumptions) Norms for Police Officers AVERAGE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Roulo provided a concise and clipped account of his personal and professional background that contained most essential details but very little elaboration. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this  demonstrated average writing ability, as he was able to express himself in complete sentences that contained proper grammar, punctuation, and syntax. This candidate will stick to the facts (as he perceives them) in his reports and documentation. He may need to be a bit more thorough and explanatory at times, and we also have some concerns about just how accurately his perceptions of events match with reality. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Roulo to possess average to above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his academic and occupational accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our tests of mental ability cited above. During his high school years at Joliet Central, Mr. Roulo was an outstanding student who participated in sports and was a member of the school e2 80 99s ROTC and NHS. In addition, he reportedly worked full-time his senior year. He was disappointed when his attempt to be accepted to the U.S. Military Academy was denied, but was offered an ROTC scholarship to Purdue University which he declined, which he cryptically stated would be too far from home. Consequently, he went on to obtain his bachelor e2 80 99s degree with a double major in history and political science from NIU in 2010. However, his commencement was interrupted when his National Guard unit was activated for a yearlong deployment to Afghanistan. All things considered, we have little doubt that this bright individual will be able to master the essential information required of a police officer. Of concern, however, is Mr. Roulo e2 80 99s emotional and social intelligence which we believe will interfere with his capacity to apply what he has learned in the actual performance of his duties due to some of his personality characteristics (documented in Parts II and IV of this report).  The youngest of three children, Mr. Roulo grew up in Joliet where he attended local public schools. According to Mr. Roulo, he has never met his biological father. Raised by his mother and step-father (whose name he adopted at the age of 17), Mr. Roulo e2 80 99s mother passed away in 2006 during while he was home on Spring Break during his second year of college because of a reported overdose of medications. Mr. Roulo e2 80 99s mother and step-father divorced when he was about 17. Although he reported conflicts with his step-father over the years, he remains in contact with him and is living with him currently. We mention these unfortunate and difficult circumstances as a means to help understand the underpinnings of some of Mr. Roulo e2 80 99s documented difficulties with anger management, resentment, , and proclivity toward challenging established protocols that may not be in line with his moralistic and rigid sense of right and wrong. Although he has tried to affiliate and integrate into military and paramilitary organizations in order to be part of making the world a better place, Mr. Roulo has struggled in his ability to get along with his peers and superiors because of his temper and chronic complaining, which persists even with his current job with an armored truck company. This  has engaged in fist fights with peers over relatively minor slights and conflicts to a point in which he became known as someone to avoid or stay away from. So outraged with the politics of the previous presidential administration, Mr. Roulo resigned from the Border Patrol which frustrated him to a point in which he nearly lost his life after crashing his motorcycle after drinking. According to Mr. Roulo, that incident more or less led to his decision to leave the Border Patrol. Since that time he has been applying for selected police officer positions primarily with larger communities because he believes he will be granted more freedom on the streets than he was granted as a Border Patrol agent to initiate his own activity. We found that to be a rather scary thought. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Roulo to be an unacceptable  for the position in question, as he received unfavorable ratings on nearly all of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. In summation, Mr. Roulo is a rather sad and emotionally troubled  who seems to be well aware of his low tolerance for frustration, impulsivity, rigidity, and anger management issues which have thwarted his success in various occupational venues. As he stated during his assessment, if money were no object he would e2 80 9cleave society and be reclusive sustaining just me and my wife. e2 80 9d Mr. Roulo does not have a wife, and he also indicated in his interview that he has had difficulty maintaining close or intimate relationships because he drives them away with his criticism and dissatisfaction with them. In light of our numerous concerns and reservations from a psychological perspective, we would not recommend that Mr. Roulo be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Wheaton, Illinois. \"',\n",

Can be a bit vulnerable when it comes to criticism or being called out for mistakes at this point, in which he will try very hard to earn the respect and trust of his peers and superiors.   Below Average Average Above Average   ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE  ABOVE AVERAGE ABOVE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Schorn provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that contained essential details and a degree of elaboration when it was helpful to do so. With the other two written exercises, this individual demonstrated the capacity to express himself in complete and coherent sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. We also noticed that he tends to rush himself at times, yet the essence of what he was trying to communicate was clear and explicit. We do not believe Mr. Schorn will have difficulty producing thorough and professional reports. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Schorn to possess slightly above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability, and by some of his occupational accomplishments to date. Mr. Schorn graduated from Grayslake North High School a few months ago with a reported 2.70 GPA. Although he was not involved in any extracurricular activities, Mr. Schorn spent his free time working part-time. Admittedly not a e2 80 9cfan e2 80 9d of formal classroom environments, this individual has the capacity to master college-level coursework. Given his commitment, determination, and enthusiasm, we do not believe he will encounter difficulty mastering the essential information and skills required to become a paramedic and firefighter. We also found his critical thinking ability to be slightly above average.  The youngest of three children, Mr. Schorn was born, raised, and continues to reside in suburban Grayslake where he attended local public schools. With his mother being a registered nurse, the idea of pursuing a career in healthcare appealed to him at an early age. After taking a couple of courses at CLC pertaining to EMS and fire science, Mr. Schorn began e2 80 9cdreaming about e2 80 9d a fire service career with the encouragement and support of his mother. With only an EMT-B certification under his belt and a little bit of direct experience, Mr. Schorn came across as eager and ready to go with respect to his academy training and paramedic e2 80 99s coursework. An enthusiastic and relatively mature young , we believe Mr. Schorn will make the best of his opportunities, and should be a pleasure to supervise. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Schorn to be an acceptable  for the position in question, as he received favorable ratings on all of the key dimensions connected with success as a part-time firefighter and medic. When asked what he is most proud of in his relatively young life, Mr. Schorn beamed saying, e2 80 9cBeing right here right now testing for Countryside Fire, e2 80 9d adding that it has been his longtime dream to be affiliated with the CFPD. Overall, we liked the balance he brings to the position in terms of his solid work ethic, energy level, and amiable and upbeat interpersonal style. At the same time, he realizes he is young and inexperienced, but is eager to prove to his coworkers and supervisors that he is fully capable of performing essential job functions competently. Over time, we anticipate that he will do just that. In light of our positive review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Schorn be given an offer to work as a Part-Time Firefighter for the Countryside Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

Name: Joseph Schubert Position: Police Officer Age: 28 Department: Police Department Date: June 17, 2019     : Professionally attired in a dress shirt and tie and well-groomed for his appointment Quiet communication style; will be seen as introverted and disinterested Soft spoken person with low energy; dazed and confused at times Able to engage in sparse conversation Will not be seen as an approachable or credible officer given his low energy and rather timid and bewildered nature  y  : Minimal self-awareness; not particularly interested in others and will struggle to relate Homeschooled until his high school years and admittedly did not make many friends or seek out socializing with others until later in life Admittedly had difficultly fitting in during his high school and college years Will not find much in common with his fellow officers; will keep to himself Not likely to be viewed as a credible or dependable back-up officer by fellow officers due to his disconnected social style and apparent apathy Inoffensive but detached    : Likely to be disinterested in his interactions with citizens We suspect that his interest in police work has more to do with enhancing his sense of self-esteem rather than any genuine interest in serving the public Claims that he wants to be in a helping role, but has not found any role that suits him Other pursuits have been related to es and working in the restaurant industry Candidate indicated that one of the major draws of this career was the possibility of working with dogs in the K-9 unit  relevant work and life experience  : This 28-year-old candidate has not prepared himself in any discernible way for the position in question Reportedly his girlfriend e2 80 99s relative encouraged him to apply to the Bolingbrook PD; this is the only department to which he made application Has not completed an internship or any ride time; no experience with emergencies at all A reservist in the Marine Corps for over four years and earned an E-5 ranking, he described this position of repairing radios as doing e2 80 9ca lot of sitting around and waiting e2 80 9d Extensive experience working in sandwich shops and is currently employed in a es position that he is wanting to leave   : Easily loses focus and shows signs of selective motivation; lacks self-discipline Attempted to go to college on three different occasions and did not follow through for various reasons Has changed career paths multiple times to include pursuing jobs in the restaurant industry, es, business, the Marines, and now police work Scored low on our measures of conscientiousness and agreeableness Previous bosses have criticized him for lack of focus; often plays on his phone and engages in other unrelated tasks when he is not stimulated by his work Fired from Potbelly e2 80 99s in 2012 for showing up late too many times    : Though he will treat those in authority positions with respect, this candidate will not adapt easily to a law enforcement setting that requires constant interaction with others Expects his supervisors to be e2 80 9cfirm but fair e2 80 9d; our assessment indicates that this candidate will require more firmness than fairness Lacking in motivation; will require constant external direction, supervisors will quickly tire of reminding this candidate of what he needs to be doing Will require a lot of supervisory oversight  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Disconnected interpersonal style and passive disposition will significantly impact his credibility and capacity to project an authoritative bearing Lacks assertiveness and conviction in his communication style and body language, which could impact his ability to effectively enforce laws and ordinances This kind of passive demeanor will invite resistance from confrontational subjects Does not seem particularly interested in the enforcement aspects of the job, as he talked about wanting to work with dogs    : Lacks social maturity and awareness especially as it pertains to his ability to function as a capable and functional adult Although he reported some shortcomings, he has not done much to change these areas of deficiency and does not appear to know how Currently living in a home that his girlfriend owns because his credit score did not allow for him to own a home; this dependent individual has yet to establish himself as an independent and autonomous adult Experimented with smoking marijuana in high school, but currently stays away from drugs and alcohol Has avoided any run-ins with the law except for a handful of speeding tickets    : Lacks experience working in stressful conditions; he is likely to become flustered and confused under pressure The demands of the job will be too much for this person to handle; when pressure and expectations have exceeded his tolerance level at jobs, he has left or been terminated Unprepared for the negativity and resistance that he will encounter in this line of work or in any other public safety position Overall, this  is not a very good fit for a law enforcement career, as he will encounter inordinate difficulty dealing with the complicated challenges that he will face in this line of work We do not believe this  has a realistic perception of what will be required of him as a police officer  We question the commitment of this candidate e2 80 99s seriousness about pursuing a career in police work. He lacks motivation especially when he is uninterested. He will not demonstrate any motivation. He lacks assertiveness, focus, and self-discipline required to integrate critical feedback.        s)       Overall, we evaluate Mr. Schubert to possess above average mental ability. This assertion is based upon his scores on our standardized tests of cognitive ability cited above and his ability to articulate himself. Though Mr. Schubert has innate intelligence, he lacks motivation and focus. He graduated high school with a 3.2/5.0 GPA and was unable to complete a degree from the following institutions: Northern Illinois University, the College of DuPage, and DeVry University. With respect to his writing ability, Mr. Schubert can express himself on paper in clear and coherent sentences that generally contain proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. While he possesses the intellectual capacity to learn the essential information required for the position in question, this individual e2 80 99s marginal social skills and low motivation will significantly impede his ability to apply that information in the actual performance of his duties as a police officer. Lackadaisical and socially awkward with a low tolerance for stress and frustration, we expect this candidate to be quickly overwhelmed during his field training and probationary period. Based on his history, he is an underachiever.  Mr. Schubert currently resides in Aurora, Illinois, where he lives with his girlfriend in the home she owns with their two dogs. Glen Ellyn, Illinois, is where this candidate was raised and homeschooled. He lived with his biological parents and older sister until his parents divorced when he was 16 years old. Around the time his parents divorced, the candidate reported to have gained approximately one hundred pounds during his high school years at Marmion Academy. A few years ago, he committed to living a healthier lifestyle. On another note, Mr. Schubert said that one of the values his parents impressed upon him was e2 80 9csticking with things and finishing them, e2 80 9d which he has obviously not been able to accomplish given his academic and employment records cited in this report. We do not see this changing any time soon. Although this candidate is an intelligent young man, he struck us as an underachiever who lacks discipline and motivation. Moreover, this candidate was most animated and excited about training his dogs, yet we have concerns about his ability to effectively engage with people including citizens and coworkers. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Schubert to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. Mr. Schubert has changed places of employment rather often, and more notable he has not taken it upon himself to prepare himself in any way for the challenges that await him as a police officer. Mr. Schubert is currently working in es and lacks direction regarding what he wants to do with his career. Therefore, we question his commitment, desire, and maturity to become an effective officer. In light of our many concerns and reservations, we would recommend that the Village of Bolingbrook take a pass on offering Mr. Schubert a position as a Police Officer. ERL/\"',\n",

A bit of patience on the part of Lieutenants and senior blue-shirts will pay dividends over time, as this individual has the capacity to develop into an asset to the District and the citizens it serves.        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Schultz provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background that contained essential details and dates. In the other written exercises he was required to complete, this articulate young man expressed himself in complete sentences that contained proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Mr. Schultz is also a very conscientious individual who will take the time to produce professional and informative reports and documentation. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Schultz to possess above average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his academic and occupational accomplishments to date, and by his outstanding scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. Mr. Schultz graduated from Minooka High School in 2016 with a strong 3.98 GPA and graduated with honors. Moreover, he also began taking classes pursuant to his associate e2 80 99s degree during his final two years. Determined to follow in his father e2 80 99s footsteps as a career firefighter, Mr. Schultz made quick work of his associate e2 80 99s degree in fire science at Joliet Junior College while at the same time completing a fire academy and completing his paramedic coursework. We believe this took a great deal of discipline and determination on the part of this motivated individual. Mr. Schultz has the ability master the essential information and skills required to obtain advanced fire service certifications.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Schultz to be an acceptable  for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all of the relevant dimensions connected with success as a firefighter and medic. Turning 21 in a week, Mr. Schultz was beaming about an upcoming trip to the Florida Keys with his family where they will all celebrate together. Coupled with being processed by the only fire department to which he has made application with a conditional offer, Mr. Schultz could not be happier and more excited. In this regard, Mr. Schultz very much enjoys the closeness he feels for his family which will translate into his development of positive and collaborative working relationships with his peers and superiors with the CSFPD. Secondly, the prospect of working with his father with the department is also very appealing despite some of the chop-busting he has already undergone at Morris FPD (which also employs some current Carol Stream FPD firefighters). Mr. Schultz takes that kind of ribbing with a smile and seems to enjoy it. There certainly is a lot to like about this young, motived, and very bright recruit, as we liked the balance he brings to the position in terms of his pleasant and sincere interpersonal style and his strong task orientation and work ethic. In light of our review of his qualifications and personality characteristics, we would recommend that Mr. Schultz be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Carol Strean Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

Mr. Siemsen attempted to answer most questions in a thorough manner, but there were careless errors still noticeable. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On both of his exercises, this  demonstrated acceptable writing ability, as the candidate was attentive to details and wrote in relatively clear and complete sentences. Mr. Siemsen also made the proper use of grammar and syntax. More importantly, he showed common sense and sound judgment in evaluating the simulated problems posed to him. All told, we believe that he will handle the paperwork and report writing demands of the position in an acceptable manner, but it would be helpful to have an additional set of eyes scan through his work until he gets plenty of practice. Mr. Siemsen reports receiving above average grades throughout his high school and college years, and we sense that his accomplishments have come with some hard work and effort on his part. His scores on our tests measuring cognitive ability cited above seem to echo our evaluation that Mr. Siemsen has relatively average brainpower, yet it is valuably supplemented by his eagerness and spirit. Overall, Mr. Siemsen demonstrates the proper thinking skills to learn and the aptitude to apply his knowledge in the performance of his duties and responsibilities of a sworn police officer.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Siemsen to be an acceptable  for the position in question. From an early age, Mr. Siemsen knew that he wanted to become a police officer, like his father before him. Through his father he was exposed to the other officers in the Homewood Police Department. Seeing the positive impact of the police was enough to convince the candidate that he was pursuing the right career choice. On the other hand, Mr. Siemsen gave some thought during high school to exploring filmmaking or drawing cartoons, but at the same time, the candidate realized that the likelihood of making a decent living in these professions was not good. To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, Mr. Siemsen has pursued classes in criminal justice at a local community college. In addition, he has gained valuable experience in auxiliary roles in Midlothian and Crestwood as well as Chicago Heights, where he performed surveillance activities on prisoners. In light of this last position, the agency itself should be able to confirm our findings. We are impressed with his strong work ethic along with his good judgment and common sense e2 80 93 all qualities that are critical for effectively doing the job. Therefore, based our overall favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Siemsen be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Chicago Heights. \"',\n",

We administered two writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). On all of his exercises, this  demonstrated solid writing ability. More specifically, the candidate was quite attentive to the important most details. Moreover, Mr. Solorio wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, while paying close attention to making use of the proper grammar and syntax. This bodes well for Mr. Solorio completing paperwork and writing police reports, even though he states being behind a desk is something that he would like to avoid in his job. A review of the above-reported test results -- with the exception of his lower than expected score on the quantitative portion of the  -- predicts positively for Mr. Solorio e2 80 99s performance on the job. Already trained at an accredited police academy through his present job in East Chicago, Indiana, Mr. Solorio will have a relatively flat learning curve in his new role with the department in Country Club Hills.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Solorio to be an acceptable  for the position in question. The candidate claims that his initial interest in law enforcement was the result of his positive interactions and experiences with police officers in his school where he was raised in Calumet City, Illinois. To fulfill his dream of becoming a police officer, he studied criminal justice at a community college and later earned his four-year degree in the same field. This individual represents a nice combination of good  along with a solid work ethic and commitment to a career in law enforcement. We found him easy to engage in conversation and approachable as well. All of this predicts positively for working well with the public. Mr. Solorio is not a person who wishes to assert his authority over others for the sake of enhancing his self-esteem. On the other hand, he is not afraid to intervene in protecting others. Toward that end the  provided examples to support this assertion. We believe that Mr. Solorio e2 80 99s reasons for transferring departments are legitimate and reflect personal preferences that match well his needs to form a family and accommodate his fianc c3 a9 e2 80 99s residency requirements at her present place of work in Plainfield, Illinois.

In his behalf, he paid attention to using proper spelling and grammar. We also administered two other writing samples, which included a mock police report as well as a discussion of a highlight and a setback during the course of the  e2 80 99s career in law enforcement. On both of these exercises, this  demonstrated acceptable writing ability, once again, using appropriate grammar and syntax. However, his material was woefully lacking for pertinent details. As stated previously in  of this report, completing paperwork and writing police reports are a developmental need for Mr. Stevens. To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he performed well on the . All things considered, the candidate has the ability to both learn and master the essential information and skills required for the position in question. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. However, we believe the candidate demonstrates good EQ as evidenced by the way he sought help to discuss the tragedies he has witnessed on the job.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Stevens to be an acceptable  for the position in question. The candidate claims that he first expressed an interest in enlisting in the military. However, in 2013, when he was considering going to the Army, there were cutbacks in the size of military; hence, he changed his career course. It was at that time he began working with the Merrionette Park Police Department, first as a booking officer, and now as a part-time patrol officer. For the most part, Mr. Stevens has been satisfied with his work, but on a part-time ary, he needs a second job in order to help make ends meet. At present, Mr. Stevens is employed as an armed guard, performing private security for Sentinel Investigations, a job that he has held since August of 2016. The promise of full-time employment with the Alsip Police Department is motivating Mr. Stevens to seek the position in question. As stated above, the  has been a loyal employee with the Merrionette Park Police Department. It appears as though Mr. Stevens has been productive even though he has been assigned to the slower midnight shift with Merrionette Park Police Department. On the other hand, this candidate has been cautioned to slow down and take his time, especially with police reports, which are matters of public record and often appear in courtroom proceedings. In addition, he has been cautioned about tardiness. On the other hand, he has proven to be a good officer who merits an opportunity to continue his career in law enforcement. Therefore, in light of our overall, generally favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Stevens be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Alsip. \"',\n",

We also administered two other writing samples (both of which were typed). On both of these exercises, Mr. Swigart wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, using proper grammar and syntax yet reflected a poor attention to detail. Because paperwork and police reports can be a matter of public record, Mr. Swigart e2 80 99s poor attention to detail could be a cause for concern. As a result, we strongly recommend that his FTO e2 80 99s and supervisors monitor his paperwork and report writing very carefully during his probationary period. As can be seen by his strong performance on both sections of the , Mr. Swigart is quite bright. With respect to his sensitivities towards other people along with his ability to read and interpret social cues, we are less optimistic. While not totally lacking in emotional intelligence, it is not one of the  e2 80 99s stronger attributes.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Swigart to be an acceptable  for the position in question. The candidate was born into a military family, when his father was serving in the U.S. Navy. At a very young age, his parents divorced one another and remarried. Both parents have children by their new spouses. According to the candidate, he has good relations with both of his step-parents as well as his step-siblings. As we stated in  of this report, Mr. Swigart struggled during high school. Attending a large, public high school in Orange County, California, Mr. Swigart e2 80 99s father found a small private high school in Utah, which the  attended. Nevertheless, it was Mr. Swigart e2 80 99s enlistment in the Navy that changed his life and his outlook. While trained as an on-board firefighter by the Navy, the candidate feels a greater affinity toward a career in law enforcement. Seeing law enforcement as a more proactive job in terms of interacting directly with the community, he is comfortable in adjusting his career ambitions. Although the  acknowledges that there will be time away from friends and family, especially during the early years of his career as a police officer, he has experienced similar conditions while serving in the armed services. Other than the need to appear more approachable as well as needing to pay closer attention to paperwork and report writing, we have few concerns about the  e2 80 99s ability to perform his job as a municipal police officer. Therefore, in light of our overall, favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Swigart be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the City of Chicago Heights. \"',\n",

both awarded in May of 2018 Earned his EMT-B from Christ Advocate Hospital in 2013; earned his paramedic e2 80 99s license from the same location in 2016 B.O.F. was received through the Romeoville Fire Academy in 2016 Spent four and a half years from May of 2014 until nuary of 2019 as a telemetry monitor technician at Palos Health Worked for just three months with the Tri-State Fire Protection District Currently employed as a firefighter/paramedic at two fire protection districts in Hometown and Palos   : At present, this person works about 72 hours a week at the two above mentioned jobs in Hometown and Palos Rates reasonably high on most measures of conscientiousness However, we did detect a low score relating to the  e2 80 99s dutifulness; low scorers are more casual about ethical principals and moral obligations The ethical principal of honesty has been called into question for this  after misrepresenting his employment history    : Raised in a household as a child to respect authority; his father is a former Burbank Police Officer With his low measure of dutifulness, this individual might not always faithfully follow the rules Despite being cautioned to be truthful prior to his interview with the psychologist, this person concealed important information regarding his ability to relate well to authority In particular, we had information prior to this person e2 80 99s appointment that he had been terminated from a prior department for problems with his temper; however, the candidate reported to us no terminations and no disciplinary actions when asked This misrepresentation of information regarding his termination from a previous place of employment is very disturbing, to say the least    : With the large number of nursing homes in his fire protection districts, the  is well-acquainted with fatalities Along this same line, he described the horrific sight and smell emanating from the home of a long-expired elderly patient who was discovered during a well-being check The  expressed sympathy for those individuals who die alone, indicating that he possesses a fair degree of empathy He has also encountered fatal automobile accidents The candidate claims that he finds such incidents as troubling, but he is able to debrief with his fellow officers once back at the firehouse    : The  has managed to avoid any trouble with the law We suspect that with a father who was former police officer, staying out of trouble was a given during his upbringing On the other hand, the  admits to using marijuana a few times The fact that he used the substance in college while studying criminal justice at St. Ambrose University does give us pause for concern In sum, this behavior in college reflects poor judgment on this person e2 80 99s part At present, this person owns a home in Frankfort and lives with his girlfriend from the last three years    : Appears committed to the fire service after initially considering a career in law enforcement After leaving college where he was studying criminal justice, he has been focused on becoming a firefighter/paramedic The stress caused by changing careers was substantial; however, with reassurance from his father about making the move to the fire service the  seems to be a in a better place Away from the job he engages in home improvement projects on his home He also spends time with his friends from childhood with whom he plays sports Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Because of this person e2 80 99s failure to recognize and tell the truth during his assessment, we question his ability to be self-aware of his shortcomings and the need for any improvement. We offer no suggestions for further training and development as he is unlikely to hear or incorporate constructive feedback.        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Touhy took the time to provide detailed information on his Personal History Form, although some of it was not very accurate. All of his education and job-related credentials were carefully accounted for on this document. On the other hand, the level of information and detail that he offered in an exercise designed to discuss a highlight and setback during the course of his career was rather sparse, a marked contrast to our earlier observation about Mr. Touhy e2 80 99s written communication skills. Nonetheless, we think that this individual will be able to handle acceptably the paperwork and reporting requirements for the position in question. Based on his above-reported results on the , Mr. Touhy is quite intelligent. It is also worth mentioning that he is in possession of three associate e2 80 99s degrees, all from Moraine Valley Community College. As noted earlier in  of this report, two of those associate e2 80 99s degrees are in fire science and emergency medical services (EMS). Overall, we evaluate Mr. Touhy to possess the proper thinking skills as they pertain to the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Touhy to be an unacceptable  for the position in question. He presents himself as a suitable candidate for the job of firefighter/paramedic with many fine attributes for the job in question. However, we base this final decision on the fact that Mr. Touhy was told explicitly to be truthful and honest during the assessment process. From information obtained through his prospective employer, the Palos Fire Protection District, we learned that Mr. Touhy was terminated from another fire protection district for problems with controlling his temper. The candidate claims that he resigned from the Tri-State Fire Protection District e2 80 9cdue to a change in family dynamics. e2 80 9d This dishonesty and breach of protocol is enough to disqualify the candidate from our perspective. The situation is unfortunate, since as noted above, he was rated acceptably on most dimensions designed to measure effective performance in the fire service and EMS. In addition, as shown above in  of this report, Mr. Touhy is quite intelligent. If the Palos Fire Protection District is interested in investigating this incident in greater depth, that is the choice of the department. However, due to the circumstances as just explained in this portion of the report, we would not feel comfortable recommending that Mr. Touhy be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Palos Fire Protection District. \"',\n",

May need some reminders to be more patient and slow things down in order to focus on officer safety concerns before taking action. On the plus side, this individual seems to connect rather quickly with most people and leaves a positive impression. Likely to be very adept at community service assignments.        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Tschammer provided a neatly typed account of his personal and professional background which contained essential details but not much elaboration. We also administered two other writing samples (one handwritten and the other typed). In all exercises, this  demonstrated average writing ability as he was able to demonstrate the ability to express himself in complete and coherent sentences using proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Tschammer to possess average mental ability. This assertion is supported by his academic and occupational accomplishments to date, and by his scores on our standardized test of cognitive ability cited above. Mr. Tschammer graduated from Schaumburg High School in 2009 with a reported 3.50 GPA. During his high school years he was involved in sports for about two years, then began working part-time. However, upon graduation, this individual was given the e2 80 9cschool spirit e2 80 9d award which is in line with the e2 80 9cHappiness Award e2 80 9d he recently received at his current job 10 years later. Although he was originally interested in a law enforcement career, Mr. Tschammer became involved with weightlifting and physical training during his early college years. As a result, he went on to receive his bachelor e2 80 99s degree in physical education from ISU in 2013, but has not ever really worked in that field. Nevertheless, we found Mr. Tschammer to be a fairly bright and highly motivated individual who has the ability to master the essential job functions required of a police officer.  Mr. Tschammer is the youngest of three boys who grew up in suburban Schaumburg where he still resides with his parents at the age of 28. Upon graduating from high school his intention was to pursue a career in police work, however that changed after he developed an interest in weight training and exercise. During his interview, Mr. Tschammer talked about the frustration he experienced applying for teaching positions in the physical education field, and ended up taking a job as an HVAC technician for his local school district where he has advanced into more responsible positions. We believe Mr. Tschammer is at a point in his life in which he needs to step out of his comfort zone and begin pursuing his vocational aspirations with more determination and focus. In this regard, he came across as excited and enthusiastic about the prospect of working as a Hanover Park police officer. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Tschammer to be an acceptable  for the position in question as he received favorable ratings on all but one of the key dimensions connected with success as a police officer. An engaging and socially adept individual with a positive attitude, Mr. Tschammer also presents himself in a confident and capable manner. Although he has not had much exposure to police operations other than two ride-alongs and some part-time work as a security bouncer during his college years, this individual possesses a realistic perception of what awaits him during the course of his training and education as a police officer, as well as, some of the risks and downsides inherent in a policing career. We view this  as very trainable, coachable, and focused, as he looks forward to this dramatic career change in his life. With some guidance and support from his supervisors, Mr. Tschammer has the potential to develop into a capable and productive officer over time. In light of our review, we would recommend that Mr. Tschammer be extended an offer of employment to serve as a Police Officer for the Village of Hanover Park, Illinois. \"',\n",

Name: Edgar Urquizo Position: Police Officer Age: 30 Department: Police Department Date: December 4, 2018     : Well groomed, and appropriately attired for his appointment at our office Admitted he was very anxious which was consistent with his shaky voice, trouble swallowing, and facial twitches; obviously nervous and jittery Several nervous mannerisms, which will detract from his ability to project a confident and capable police presence Long-winded and tangential responses; struggled with communication and talked in circles Expressionless tone without much demonstrable emotion; admitted difficulty e2 80 9cputting [himself] in other people e2 80 99s minds e2 80 9d Likely to be viewed as lacking in compassion and confusing in the way he expresses himself  y  : Not a very social or outgoing individual Self-contained candidate who limits his engagement to family and few close friends Talks a lot but lacks clarity in his tangential anecdotes and stories Likely to be viewed as self-conscious and a bit eccentric by his fellow officers; very difficult to follow his stream of communication Low needs for inclusion and acceptance from others; not much evidence to classify this rather self-serving individual as a team player Concerns about his social adeptness and ability to accurately read or understand people (or himself) For example, when asked what a common misconception that others have of him is, he said e2 80 9cprobably that I am a partier because sometimes people invite me to parties e2 80 9d    : Rates low on our measures of altruism; focused entirely on his own personal needs for comfort and convenience Minimal mention of any desire to help or assist others; has not been involved in any type of charitable or community service activities in his life Not entirely sure about what is motivating him to pursuing a career in police work other than his interest in weaponry and a need to make his children proud of him The only discernible interest he was able to state involved his desire to become a member of the SWAT team For example, when asked why he wanted to become a police officer he rambled off a story about running into an officer and e2 80 9cbeing reminded e2 80 9d that he wanted to pursue this career; this happened relatively recently Recently talked to a local officer about the job, but was primarily interested in asking questions about the officer e2 80 99s service weapon; recently obtained his FOID card and license to conceal and carry Primarily drawn to the enforcement aspects of the job stating that he e2 80 9cknows what it is like to be afraid e2 80 9d in Chicago Heights  relevant work and life experience  : Since 2013 this candidate has been working for Mace Iron Works as a welder No mention of any type of journeyman status, but reportedly has one subordinate who he refers to as his e2 80 9cpartner e2 80 9d No formal education beyond a diploma from Bloom Township High School On his behalf,  is bilingual (Spanish) Absolutely no exposure to police operations or criminal justice coursework Tried to get a ride-along once, but the department did not call him back, so he did not pursue it further Some customer service experience in what appears to be his father e2 80 99s restaurant business prior to working in the trades No experience in conflict resolution, rules enforcement, or maintaining order   : Raised by his parents to value hard work and responsibility Employed at his parent e2 80 99s bakery since age 12; consistently employed in some capacity since that time Reliable, dependable, and consistent with basic work habits; shows up and does what he is told Related to his circumlocution and difficulty in providing clear and relevant statements about himself, this candidate seems to confuse essential from non-essential details This has been a problem for him as he was disciplined for overlooking a dangerous safety concern (and not reporting it) which could have caused a coworker to be at risk for falling two stories Although he seems to perform job functions adequately, we did not get the sense that he is particularly concerned about the quality and competence of his work    : Prefers to work with a supervisor who is organized, firm, respectful, outgoing, and does not get mad easily Appears to be eager to accommodate his bosses, but may not always accurately comprehend what is expected of him Not a very disciplined or organized person who will struggle with the structure, rigor, and professionalism required within a paramilitary organization Nonchalance about quality performance and doing just enough to get by will likely frustrate his superiors Will require very clear and explicit direction and expectations; not advisable to leave anything to his imagination about what he needs to do Will require an inordinate amount of oversight and mentoring  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Nervous and awkward manner coupled with a confusing and ineffective communication style will hinder his ability to establish a capable and confident police presence Generally respectful and polite but likely to be obtuse and perhaps indifferent in his approach to conflicts Although he did not strike us as being very assertive, we have some concerns about his fascination with weaponry and desire to become a member of a specialized assault team coupled with his very low level of trust in others As we indicated above, this individual has difficulty with empathy and we believe he will have difficulty understanding the emotional states of victims and offenders Expected to be rigid and unyielding in his enforcement activities; encounters difficulty with ambiguity The e2 80 9ccustomer service e2 80 9d aspects of the job have not been adequately considered by this candidate    : Tried to be open and informative in discussing regrets and disappointments he has endured in life Unable to evaluate his own contribution to setbacks or problems; not very introspective Lifelong resident of Chicago Heights where he owns his own home; stable marriage and devoted to his two young children Reported consuming marijuana approximately nine times in his life with the last instance three years ago; rarely consumes alcohol Arrested twice; once for driving with a suspended license and the other time for verbally arguing with an officer, which he described as e2 80 9cfunny e2 80 9d Although rated as e2 80 9cacceptable e2 80 9d on this dimension because he has demonstrated an ability to maintain consistent employment and honor commitments, we have concerns about this candidate e2 80 99s social and emotional maturity    : Socially and emotionally stunted; some concerns about his overall level of adjustment and maturity Anxious and self-conscious individual who may be prone to prolonged periods of worry or emotional preoccupation Given this immaturity, we anticipate that he will personalize negativity and resistance; will match anger with anger Expected to be dazed and confused during his field training and probationary period Will require a good deal of monitoring and oversight; will probably create more stress for his supervisors and fellow officers than he may actually experience himself Seems preoccupied with self-defense; studied and still practices karate and has recently become interested in guns Overall, this individual did not strike us as a very good fit for any type of public safety work  Numerous concerns and reservations about this individual e2 80 99s capacity to perform the essential job functions required of a police officer. Most of these issues involve characterological and personality attributes that will not be readily amenable to change with further education, training, or mentoring. As a result, we will defer on making any specific recommendations for improvement.   Below Average Average Above Average   AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE  AVERAGE AVERAGE      s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s on-line materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Urquizo took the time to fill out the Personal History Form accurately and used proper grammar and sentence structure for the most part. In an exercise that asked him to provide a highlight and setback he has experienced in his life, he wrote in a matter-of-fact way lacking much of an emotional connection to the material. For the mock police report, he expressed himself in a similarly verbose manner exerting very heavy pen pressure on the paper suggesting a degree of strong emotion and tension while producing it. This candidate tends to miss the point with his responses to questions and statements which lead us to believe the accuracy and detail included in his report writing will constantly need to be scrutinized. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Urquizo to possess average mental ability despite his lack of formal education beyond high school. A mechanically-inclined individual who prefers working with his hands, we did not find it surprising after reviewing his test results and interview questions that he elected to defer furthering his formal education, as conceptual thinking and abstract information tend to add to his already confused perception of what is going on around him. Although he may be adept with step-by-step and sequential learning methods, this candidate will struggle to envision a bigger picture to the nature of his work, especially as a public servant. Furthermore, Mr. Urquizo e2 80 99s communication skills and marginal emotional intelligence (EQ) will be problematic and difficult to overcome with training or education. In summation, we have significant doubts about Mr. Urquizo e2 80 99s ability to master the essential information and skills required to become a police officer.  Mr. Urquizo was born in Mexico and moved to Chicago Heights, Illinois, with his family when he was three years old. One of four children, this bilingual (Spanish)  rarely communicates with his siblings, but still talks to his mother occasionally. A rather isolative and self-contained individual, Mr. Urquizo has never demonstrated a strong desire to be a viable part of any functioning group working toward a common goal or mission other than working in his family e2 80 99s bakery since the age of 12. Married to his wife of about 10 years, he seems most loyal and devoted to her and his two young children aged seven and two, respectively. Employed as a welder for the past 10 years, Mr. Urquizo rather suddenly began thinking about becoming a police officer, but was unable to adequately articulate in any kind of convincing manner what his motivation might be to enter the public safety field. The best we could gather and surmise through his circuitous and longwinded explanations is that the status of the position coupled with the chance to utilize weaponry is particularly appealing to him. There is nothing in Mr. Urquizo e2 80 99s personal or professional background to indicate that he has extended himself in any discernible way to assist others in need, and we believe his self-report of lacking in empathy is quite accurate. Although he acknowledged that Chicago Heights has some dangerous neighborhoods and individuals within its confines, this  is ill-prepared to address these problems given his poor communication and conflict resolution skills, as well as, his lack of appreciation or even acknowledgement of the customer service aspects of the job e2 80 93 other than taking down a e2 80 9cbad guy e2 80 9d who poses a threat, as a member of the SWAT team. Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Urquizo to be an unacceptable  for the position in question, as he received unfavorable ratings on most of the dimensions connected with success as a police officer. He has made little effort to prepare himself for this dramatic change in careers, and seemed very na c3 afve about what will be required of him in this line of work. Furthermore, his difficulty in comprehending basic concepts and inattention detail will be problematic in mastering essential job functions, which we feel will directly impact officer and citizen safety. In light of our many concerns and reservations, we would recommend that the Commission take a pass on Mr. Urquizo, and continue to search for more mature and suitable s to serve as a Chicago Heights Police Officer.

Name: Nicholas Vancura Position: Police Officer Age: 24 Department: Police Department Date: July 11, 2019     : Casually attired for his appointment at our office Although he was not neatly shaven, we found the  e2 80 99s personal appearance to be acceptable Friendly and pleasant disposition Overall, this individual is easy to engage and should be perceived as an approachable police presence  y  : He is a likeable person, who is more of an extravert than introvert A relatively laidback individual, this person will likely roll with the punches in his interactions with his fellow officers at the agency Wants to be judged on his own merits and on the quality of his work; admits that he resents individuals who try to ingratiate themselves to departmental management Reports that he has had no clashes with coworkers at any of his places of employment, including his time in the military    : Served his country for four years in the U.S. Army, showing his commitment to service Seeks a career where he can help people and contribute to public safety The discipline and rank structure associated with the military appeals to the , who would like to replicate that the same sense of order and service in a civilian role Attracted to the convenient schedule along with the higher level of activity associated with public safety positions  relevant work and life experience  : Between March of 2014 and July of 2017 fulfilled his commitment to the U.S. Army as a human intelligence collector; honorably discharged with rank E-4 During his service years was trained in prisoner interrogation; also debriefed soldiers who were deployed to Africa for peacekeeping missions Since 2013, candidate has been taking courses at four different colleges; currently lists his associate e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice as pending through Joliet Junior College Gained customer service experience while working for both the Home Depot and a local deli   : Other than his years on active duty with the U.S. Army, most of this person e2 80 99s jobs of have been relatively short-term As an energetic individual, the  acknowledges that he tends to work in spurts This has led his supervisors to caution the candidate to slow down and take his time Expected to show initiative A reliable employee who claims to rarely call off sick or be tardy for his assigned shift    : No reported history of terminations from any previous place of employment Reported receiving one disciplinary action during basic training in the Army; candidate did not specify what it was for, but it was treated as a routine counseling session Responds well to superior officers who will work alongside him and others; respects leadership-by-example Appreciates feeling trusted Since he will be new to the field of law enforcement, having an approachable and accessible supervisor will be important  ability to enforce rules, tactfulness  : Having a physically imposing presence, this person will project a credible police presence Acknowledges that he has never had to perform any kind of enforcement activities We do not anticipate that the  will abuse his authority In none of his past or present jobs, including his time in the military, has he ever held a leadership role or worked in a supervisory capacity    : Raised with a healthy set of moral values, such as honesty and respect for other people No record of arrests; received one traffic ticket Reportedly used marijuana a handful of times, with his last usage a couple of years ago while serving in the military Holds himself accountable for his actions, and is unlikely to fault others for his shortcomings and mistakes    : Survived his commitment of duty for the U.S. Army with no signs of residual stress or fatigue that we were able to discern Eager to gain employment in law enforcement; unlikely to disrupt the process or jeopardize his long-term prospects of being a police officer Admits that he consumes between six and seven alcoholic drinks during the week This person lives with his fianc c3 a9; the couple have a seven-month old infant To relieve tension and stress this individual regularly exercises and enjoys playing video games  Caution to pace himself and avoid working either in spurts or too quickly Coaching on how to handle difficult encounters on the street, to include domestic interventions Caution about consumption of alcohol and negative effects it can have, even on days off Monitoring his paperwork and report writing to make sure that he pays attention to all of the important details        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s written materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Vancura provided accurate information on his Personal History Form, yet the level of detail he conveyed was rather minimal. We also administered two other writing samples, which were typed prior to the  e2 80 99s appointment at our office. On each of these exercises, Mr. Vancura demonstrated an acceptable level of writing ability. However, Mr. Vancura appears to have rushed through both of these exercises, which is consistent with  about the candidate e2 80 99s habit of hurrying through chores and assignments on the job. To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, Mr. Vancura wrote in clear, definitive, and complete sentences, and made an effort to use proper grammar and syntax. Overall, we evaluate Mr. Vancura to possess the proper thinking skills required to perform the essential duties and responsibilities associated with the position in question. The  e2 80 99s above stated test results on the  support the observation that he is bright.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Vancura to be an acceptable  for the position in question. Mr. Vancura developed an interest in a law enforcement career after serving just over three years of active duty in the U.S. Army. Wanting a profession that was secure and one that also offered a well-defined sense of structure and discipline, the transition from the U.S. Army to a paramilitary organization seemed quite natural. Ironically, there was something else about Mr. Vancura e2 80 99s military experience that spurred him to pursue a career in law enforcement. After Basic Training, in his role as a Human Intelligence Collector, the candidate spent the majority of his time sitting behind a desk. This led Mr. Vancura to consider pursuing a civilian career where he would be more physically active. After being honorably discharged in July of 2017, Mr. Vancura assumed several entry-level jobs to pay the bills, and eventually left them because of his self-reported desire to spend more time testing to become a full-time police officer. Over the past six years, he has attended four institutions to earn credits toward a degree in criminal justice or their equivalent program. Presently Mr. Vancura lists his associate e2 80 99s degree in criminal justice as e2 80 9cpending e2 80 9d at Joliet Junior College. Overall, we like this person e2 80 99s attitude along with his ability to work well with people. Therefore, in light of our generally favorable review, we would recommend that Mr. Vancura be given an offer to work as a Police Officer for the Village of Channahon. \"',\n",

Name: Alexander Wood Position: Firefighter Age: 26 Department: Fire Department Date: nuary 17, 2020     : Energetic and talkative To the candidate e2 80 99s credit, he does communicate clearly Straightforward and direct with his words Rates lower on our measures of agreeableness; not afraid to express what he is thinking At the same time, he might be sensitive to slight if others are equally frank and direct with him Might be perceived as self-absorbed Despite some of these less than agreeable qualities, the candidate is drawn to the camaraderie of the fire service Sees his fellow firefighters as a second family As such, he should be able to forge comfortable working relationships with his fellow officers  AND PERSONA e  : Should project a respectful, credible, and approachable presence to the members of the public Scored above average on our measures of altruism Seems sincere in his desire to help and assist others in need Genuinely wants to a make a positive impact on the lives of other people Also drawn to the variety, activity, and mental and physical challenges involved in the fire service and EMS For example, he scored exceptionally high on our measures of excitement-seeking The  is also drawn to many of the perks and benefits associated with a career in the fire service For example, he likes the long-term benefits, to include a secure retirement package On the other hand, he is wary of the long hours away from friends and family  AND READINESS   : Earned both his B.S. degree and M.S. degree in exercise science from Eastern Illinois University in 2015 and 2016, respectively EMT-B through Elite Ambulance in Mokena, Illinois Has been employed on private ambulances for Elite Ambulance and the Mitchell Jerdan Ambulance Service since early 2018 Expected to honor his commitments and obligations On the other hand, this person experienced some difficulty acknowledging or envisioning his own contributions to problems or setbacks when they occurred He tended to offer excuses in order to rationalize his behavior when things did not go as expected However, he has had no brushes with law enforcement Reports no use of any kind of illegal drugs From all indications this individual began assuming responsibility for himself and his actions at an early age, as he had to contend with a mother who was diagnosed with a serious mental illness  AND ADAPTABILITY   : Active, energetic, and dedicated individual with an acceptable work ethic At present this person is working two jobs, one as a personal trainer at a small, private gym, and the other as an EMT-B with the Mitchell Jerdan Ambulance Service Rates above average on our measures of conscientiousness, which was reflected in n the materials that he submitted as part of his assessment Rates high on our measures of achievement Competitive person who will strive to meet or exceed departmental performance standards in most areas Has had mixed relations with most of the authority figures in his life due largely to the problems that he encountered at home On the other hand, the  has followed the rules throughout most of his life Reports being terminated in 2017 from a Target store for attendance issues, where he had a part-time job On the other hand, the candidate claims that he has had no other disciplinary actions at any past or present place of work  ability to cope with stress, remain composed, be assertive  : Because his ambulance company is serving a smaller community, he has been involved in running 911 calls As such, he has dealt with a fair number of emergencies and trauma for someone with just his EMT-B  has been able to adaptively cope with some of the more stressful and disturbing aspects of life in the fire service and EMS work thus far Has weathered gruesome situations, such as a badly decomposed body Approaches his job in a matter-of-fact manner Keeps himself in very good physical condition since he is a personal trainer is his other part-time job Small but supportive base of friends Not prone toward prolonged periods of worry or depression With the proper training, some additional life experience, and greater maturity under his belt, we expect his  to improve over time However, he possesses one potentially harmful habit that might impair his performance on the job at some point in his career In particular, the candidate consumes alcohol to excess, stating that he has as many as ten drinks in an evening two or three times a month  Caution about his alcohol consumption which exceeds the limits of binge drinking on a far too frequent basis Encouragement to gain additional certifications and training that will add to his ability to perform the job in question        s)       Regarding the candidate e2 80 99s materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Wood submitted a Personal History Form that was accurate and contained sufficient detail and information. Further in his favor, Mr. Wood used proper spelling and grammar on his Personal History Form. We also administered another writing sample, which included a highlight and a setback during the  e2 80 99s career. On this particular exercise, this  demonstrated acceptable writing ability by presenting both situations in a logical and organized fashion with the appropriate grammar and syntax as well as the pertinent details. Mr. Wood gave a mixed performance on the , but all things considered, the candidate has the ability to learn the essential information and skills required for the position in question. He has demonstrated the ability to master college coursework. Finally, with respect to the notion of emotional intelligence (EQ), or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior while navigating the social complexities of the workplace to make the best decisions for positive results, there is no univerly accepted test to measure the concept. On the other hand, we did not observe many indicators that the  possesses emotional intelligence. In particular, his rather self-absorbed personality leaves him little opportunity to show empathy and understanding for other people.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Wood to be a generally acceptable  for the position in question. According to the candidate, it was approximately three years ago that he became e2 80 9cfed up e2 80 9d with his chosen profession of fitness training. In particular, the candidate characterized the clientele at the health club that employed him, Lifetime Fitness, as problematic. Members would not keep their scheduled appointments with him for their fitness training. In these instances, Mr. Wood was unable to get paid. In other cases, the candidate would encounter clients who showed up on time, but failed to follow their prescribed fitness regimens. As with many individuals who burnout at their jobs, not seeing results for one e2 80 99s efforts is the main reason for the problem. During this period of frustration, Mr. Wood spoke with a friend who asked the  to consider a career in the fire service and EMS. With both a bachelor e2 80 99s degree and a master e2 80 99s degree in exercise science, Mr. Wood had some relevant exposure to the medical parts of his prospective job in EMS. Most of what we observed about Mr. Wood is encouraging. We find him to be a respectful individual who will present as credible and approachable to the public. He is active, energetic, driven by goals he sets for himself, and he possesses the self-discipline to accomplish them. However, his tendency to drink heavily during the weekends is disconcerting. This kind of behavior could lead to an unwanted DUI and cause the candidate to experience an early exit from the fire service and EMS, or the residual effects could drain his energy and focus. Mr. Wood might be sensitive to negative feedback, but he is a very conscientious  who wants to perform his job well. Clear expectations regarding the Department e2 80 99s views on alcohol consumption may be all that is needed to curb its use. Nevertheless, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Wood be given an offer to work as a Firefighter for the Village of Hanover Park. \"',\n",

Therefore, this report is not intended to be used for decisions about future promotions.  Name: Colin Zofkie Position: Firefighter Age: 28 Department: Fire Department Date: May 31, 2019     : Clean-cut and well-groomed personal appearance Appropriately attired in a suit and tie for his appointment at our office Offers a firm handshake At the same time he comes across as a bit awkward and stiff While professional in his demeanor, the  strikes us as somewhat less than approachable  y  : For the past five months, this person has been working part-time as a firefighter/paramedic with the Palos FPD; hence, they are familiar with his personality and  Candidate is kind of quirky, as noted by our  about his awkward presentation When asked about how his fellow firefighter/paramedics at the Palos FPD perceive him, the  acknowledges they see him as e2 80 9csickly, e2 80 9d given his numerous food allergies According to the candidate, there is a large list of foods he cannot consume for fear of an allergic reaction, including peanuts, seafood, products containing gluten, beef, and eggs We suspect his peers see him as a finicky individual    : In light of his own health struggles as a youngster, which required several extended hospital stays, this person is sensitive to those in need, and he wants to helpful to them Along this same line, being seen as helpful fills this person with a sense of pride The job of a firefighter/paramedic is held to high standards, of which he approves  acknowledges getting an adrenaline rush when the chimes sound at the fire station; hence, there is a bit of the thrill-seeker in him    : Earned his EMT-B in 2011 from Moraine Valley Community College In 2014, he received both his paramedic e2 80 99s license from Ingalls Hospital in conjunction with South Suburban College and his B.O.F. from the Frankfort Fire Protection District Works part-time at two fire departments: Evergreen Park and the other in Palos Park In total, he has been employed in the fire service and EMS for over four years Also served as an ER Tech at the Little Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park   : Between his two part-time positions in Evergreen Park and Palos Park, this person works anywhere from 80 to 100 hours a week Hardworking and reliable employee who rarely calls-off sick is tardy for shift Possesses a strong drive to succeed; committed to a career in the fire service and EMS The  did admit, however, that when he is given a specific task, tunnel vision can narrow his focus    : Was raised to respect those in authority positions Prefers clear-cut and explicit direction from his superiors A rather rigid individual, he will not perform well with ambiguous goals or expectations In turn, he wants to know where he stands with his superiors in the fire service Has never been terminated; disciplined only once at work for an expired CPR card, which occurred last year in 2018    : As mentioned previously, due in large part to his own personal circumstances, the candidate will show sensitivity toward sick and injured patients This individual has witnessed a fair amount of trauma during his time with the Evergreen Park FD as well as while an ER technician at the Little Company of Mary Hospital Openly admits to the e2 80 9cshock and awe e2 80 9d of seeing horrific accidents or injuries However, after having a e2 80 9cmoment of pause, e2 80 9d the candidate composes himself and capably addresses the situation at hand    : Reports never having been arrested; has received about a half-dozen traffic violations, mostly for speeding Expected to hold himself accountable for his actions, both on and off the job For example, he took full responsibility for being disciplined at the Little Company of Mary Hospital for his expired CPR card; no excuses were offered whatsoever Acts in a fiscally responsible manner; paid for all of his education after high school out of his own pocket, and has no outstanding loans or any other debt Married about a year after dating for eight years, the  and his wife own a home and are raising her child from a prior relationship; home mortgage is in his wife e2 80 99s name    : Candidate has lasted thus far in the fire service and EMS without any signs of burning out Fully aware of the sources of stress associated with this line of work, he has been able to manage his emotions To date, he cites the possibility of death or injury as stressful along with the amount of time he is required to spend away from family Ironically, however, when he is at home, this individual prefers to isolate himself in his garage workshop where he engages in woodworking activities Special Training, Orientation & Concerns Caution about succumbing to tunnel vision as it narrows his scope of other pressing duties and responsibilities Clear-cut goals and expectations for his performance on the job; no ambiguity about where he stands with his superior officers        s)       With regard to the candidate e2 80 99s online materials submitted as part of our assessment, Mr. Zofkie took his time to complete his Personal History Form in an accurate and detailed fashion. On another written exercise, Mr. Zofkie wrote extensively about both a highlight and a setback during the course of his career. While he offers a stiff and somewhat awkward social presence, he showed unusual sensitivity in discussing a professional setback which resulted in two deaths that occurred when he responded to a fire call. Mr. Zofkie writes exceptionally well, paying particular attention to detail, as well as showing solid writing mechanics. This kind of behavior bodes well for completing forms and paperwork related the reimbursement of expenses to the Palos Fire Protection District for its emergency medical services. The scores registered by Mr. Zofkie on the Wonderlic Basic Skills are very reassuring and predict positively for his ability to learn quickly. Mr. Zofkie maintained above average grades throughout high school and during college, emerging with his associate e2 80 99s degree in science from Moraine Valley Community College in 2011. This candidate seems to place great value on the science fields, and on education in general. Eventually, this candidate may return to the college classroom, and he should have no problem while pursuing further degrees or credentials. Overall, this person possesses the proper thinking skills in order to perform the essential duties and responsibilities for the position in question.  Based on our observations and assessment, we evaluate Mr. Zofkie to be an acceptable  for the position in question. There is a lot we like and respect about this hardworking and dedicated firefighter/paramedic. For example, he currently works as many as 80 to 100 hours a week, handling two part-time positions in the fire service. Second, he is a responsible individual who has acted assiduously in terms of financing his own education and handling his family responsibilities. The fact that this individual has been gainfully employed by the Palos Fire Protection District part-time for the past five months predicts favorably for his success going forward. Specifically, the firefighter/paramedics in the department already know and understand the candidate e2 80 99s capabilities as a fellow fire medic. From all indications, this person takes his duties and responsibilities seriously and will be diligent about doing his job. If he has a potential shortcoming, it is his tendency to focus too closely on one task to the exclusion of other assignments. While the fire officers at the Palos Fire Protection District know and understand the candidate e2 80 99s technical aptitudes and abilities, they also know his individual quirks, especially when it comes to his culinary choices and limitations. While this might make for some typical firehouse kidding, it is certainly not an issue that will interfere with Mr. Zofkie e2 80 99s ability to perform his job in a capable and competent manner. Therefore, in light of our overall review, we would recommend that Mr. Zofkie be given an offer to work full-time as a Firefighter for the Palos Fire Protection District. \"']"
